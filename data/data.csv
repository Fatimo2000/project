A Comparative Genomic Analysis of Coronavirus Families Using Chaos Game  Representation and Fisher-Shannon Complexity	S. K. Laha	2021/07/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06282v1	ArXiv	From its first emergence in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented health crisis throughout the world. The novel coronavirus disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which belongs to the coronaviridae family. In this paper, a comparative genomic analysis of eight coronaviruses namely Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Bat coronavirus RaTG13 has been carried out using Chaos Game Representation and Fisher-Shannon Complexity (CGR-FSC) measure. Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is a unique alignment-free method to visualize one dimensional DNA sequence in a two-dimensional fractal-like pattern. The two-dimensional CGR pattern is then quantified by Fisher-Shannon Complexity (FSC) measure. The CGR-FSC can effectively identify the viruses uniquely and their similarity/dissimilarity can be revealed in the Fisher-Shannon Information Plane (FSIP).	683
Is Coronavirus-Related Research Becoming More Interdisciplinary? A  Perspective of Co-occurrence Analysis and Diversity Measure of Scientific  Articles	Yi Zhao,Lifan Liu,Chengzhi Zhang	2021/11/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04344v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant repercussion on the health, economy, politics and environment, making coronavirus-related issues more complicated and difficult to solve adequately by relying on a single field. Interdisciplinary research can provide an effective solution to complex issues in the related field of coronavirus. However, whether coronavirus related research becomes more interdisciplinary still needs corroboration. In this study, we investigate interdisciplinary status of the coronavirus-related fields via the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). To this end, we calculate bibliometric indicators of interdisciplinarity and a co-occurrence analysis method. The results show that co-occurrence relationships between cited disciplines have evolved dynamically over time. The two types of co-occurrence relationships, Immunology and Microbiology & Medicine and Chemical Engineering & Chemistry, last for a long time in this field during 1990-2020. Moreover, the number of disciplines cited by coronavirus-related research increases, whereas the distribution of disciplines is uneven, and this field tends to focus on several dominant disciplines such as Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology. We also gauge the disciplinary diversity of COVID-19 related papers published from January to December 2020; the disciplinary variety shows an upward trend, while the degree of disciplinary balance shows a downward trend. Meanwhile, the comprehensive index 2Ds demonstrates that the degree of interdisciplinarity in coronavirus field decreases between 1990 and 2019, but it increases in 2020. The results help to map the interdisciplinarity of coronavirus-related research, gaining insight into the degree and history of interdisciplinary cooperation.	684
The Impact Of Social Media In The Fight Against The Spread Of  Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic In Anambra State, Nigeria	Onuegbu Okechukwu Christopher,Joseph Oluchukwu Wogu,Jude Agbo	2022/06/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05548v1	ArXiv	This study examined the impact of social media in the fight against the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Anambra state, Nigeria. The key objectives are to: find out if the numbers of social media users increased in Anambra state since the wake of coronavirus pandemic; find out if the social media is being utilised in the fight against the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Anambra state; find out how the social media is being utilised in the fight against the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Anambra state; and discover the impact of social media in the fight against the spread of coronavirus pandemic in Anambra State. It was anchored on Agenda Setting Theory, and the Technological Determinism Theory (TDT). The study was designed as a survey with close-ended questionnaire distributed to 400 respondents. The findings of this study revealed that usage and accessibility of social media increased in Anambra state because of coronavirus pandemic. It also revealed that the social media is being utilised by individuals, NGOs and government in the fight against the spread of coronavirus in Anambra state. The study also found that the social media is being utilised to gather and disseminate information, study, transact businesses, among other things. The finding also showed that the social media has positive impact in the fight against the spread of coronavirus in Anambra state. The study concluded that social media has much benefits than negative impact, and should be used to contain the spread of coronavirus. It, among other things, recommended training and empowerment of the citizens on effective utilisation of social media to create impact in the society.	685
Genomics-guided molecular maps of coronavirus targets in human cells: a  path toward the repurposing of existing drugs to mitigate the pandemic	Gennadi Glinsky	2020/03/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13665v1	ArXiv	Human genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, ACE2 and FURIN, were employed as baits to build genomics-guided maps of up-stream regulatory elements, their expression and functions in human body, including pathophysiologically-relevant cell types. Genes acting as repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1) were then employed to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed to mitigate the coronavirus infection. Present analyses identify Vitamin D and Quercetin as promising pandemic mitigation agents. Gene expression profiles of Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances suggest that they may represent viable candidates for further assessment and considerations of their potential as coronavirus pandemic mitigation agents. Notably, gene set enrichment analyses and expression profiling experiments identify multiple drugs, most notably testosterone, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of Testosterone versus Estradiol impacts on SCARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during coronavirus pandemic.	686
Identifying and Mapping the Global Research Output on Coronavirus  Disease: A Scientometric Study	Muneer Ahmad,M Sadik Batcha	2021/02/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09900v1	ArXiv	"The paper explores and analyses the trend of world literature on ""Coronavirus Disease"" in terms of the output of research publications as indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) of Web of Science during the period from 2011 to 2020. The study found that 6071 research records have been published on Coronavirus Disease till March 20, 2020. The various scientometric components of the research records published in the study period were studied. The study reveals the various aspects of Coronavirus Disease literature such as year wise distribution, relative growth rate, doubling time of literature, geographical wise, organization wise, language wise, form wise , most prolific authors, and source wise. The highest number of articles was published in the year 2019, while lowest numbers of research article were reported in the year 2020. Further, the relative growth rate is gradually increases and on the other hand doubling time decreases.

Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Strike on Arab Countries and Territories: A  Situation Report I	Omar Reyad	2020/03/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09501v1	ArXiv	The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV that first identified in Wuhan, China. The disease causes respiratory illness (such as the flu) with other symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. This new Coronavirus seems to be very infectious and has spread quickly and globally. In this work, information about COVID-19 is provided and the situation in Arab countries and territories regarding the COVID-19 strike is presented. The next few weeks main expectations is also given.	688
Prediction of number of cases expected and estimation of the final size  of coronavirus epidemic in India using the logistic model and genetic  algorithm	Ganesh Kumar M,Soman K. P,Gopalakrishnan E. A,Vijay Krishna Menon,Sowmya V	2020/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12017v1	ArXiv	In this paper, we have applied the logistic growth regression model and genetic algorithm to predict the number of coronavirus infected cases that can be expected in upcoming days in India and also estimated the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in India.	689
Coronavirus Geographic Dissemination at Chicago and its Potential  Proximity to Public Commuter Rail	Peter Fang	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12143v1	ArXiv	The community spread of coronavirus at great Chicago area has severely threatened the residents health, family and normal activities. CDC daily updates on infected cases on County level are not satisfying to address publics concern on virus spread. On March 20th, NBC5 published case information of 435 coronavirus infections. The data is relative comprehensive and of high value for understanding on the virus spread patterns at Chicago. Data engineering, natural language processing and Google map technology are applied to organize the data and retrieve geographic information of the virus. The analysis shows community spread in Chicago areas has a potential proximity relation with public commuter rail. Residents nearby major public commuter rails need limit outdoor activities during the outbreak and even the post-peak time.	690
Time Varying Markov Process with Partially Observed Aggregate Data; An  Application to Coronavirus	Christian Gourieroux,Joann Jasiak	2020/05/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04500v1	ArXiv	A major difficulty in the analysis of propagation of the coronavirus is that many infected individuals show no symptoms of Covid-19. This implies a lack of information on the total counts of infected individuals and of recovered and immunized individuals. In this paper, we consider parametric time varying Markov processes of Coronavirus propagation and show how to estimate the model parameters and approximate the unobserved counts from daily numbers of infected and detected individuals and total daily death counts. This model-based approach is illustrated in an application to French data.	691
Testing Case Number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China with  Newcomb-Benford Law	Junyi Zhang	2020/02/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05695v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 bursted out about two months ago in Wuhan has caused the death of more than a thousand people. China is fighting hard against the epidemics with the helps from all over the world. On the other hand, there appear to be doubts on the reported case number. In this article, we propose a test of the reported case number of coronavirus disease 2019 in China with Newcomb-Benford law. We find a $p$-value of $92.8\%$ in favour that the cumulative case numbers abide by the Newcomb-Benford law. Even though the reported case number can be lower than the real number of affected people due to various reasons, this test does not seem to indicate the detection of frauds.	692
Regression Approach for Modeling COVID-19 Spread and its Impact On Stock  Market	Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko	2020/04/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01489v1	ArXiv	The paper studies different regression approaches for modeling COVID-19 spread and its impact on the stock market. The logistic curve model was used with Bayesian regression for predictive analytics of the coronavirus spread. The impact of COVID-19 was studied using regression approach and compared to other crises influence. In practical analytics, it is important to find the maximum of coronavirus cases per day, this point means the estimated half time of coronavirus spread in the region under investigation. The obtained results show that different crises with different reasons have different impact on the same stocks. It is important to analyze their impact separately. Bayesian inference makes it possible to analyze the uncertainty of crisis impacts.	693
Privacy in Crisis: A study of self-disclosure during the Coronavirus  pandemic	Taylor Blose,Prasanna Umar,Anna Squicciarini,Sarah Rajtmajer	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09717v2	ArXiv	We study observed incidence of self-disclosure in a large dataset of Tweets representing user-led English-language conversation about the Coronavirus pandemic. Using an unsupervised approach to detect voluntary disclosure of personal information, we provide early evidence that situational factors surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic may impact individuals' privacy calculus. Text analyses reveal topical shift toward supportiveness and support-seeking in self-disclosing conversation on Twitter. We run a comparable analysis of Tweets from Hurricane Harvey to provide context for observed effects and suggest opportunities for further study.	694
Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm: A bioinspired metaheuristic based on  the COVID-19 propagation model	F. Martínez-Álvarez,G. Asencio-Cortés,J. F. Torres,D. Gutiérrez-Avilés,L. Melgar-García,R. Pérez-Chacón,C. Rubio-Escudero,J. C. Riquelme,A. Troncoso	2020/03/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13633v2	ArXiv	A novel bioinspired metaheuristic is proposed in this work, simulating how the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people. From an initial individual (the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates, creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either. Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance.	695
Inverted repeats in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome and implications in  evolution	Changchuan Yin,Stephen S. -T. Yau	2020/11/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12350v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused 60 millions of infections and 1.38 millions of fatalities. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design and vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a genome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene expression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity, genome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an abundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the gene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene undergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution. Comparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the spike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat distribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature. This study highlights the significance of inverted repeats in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and presents the inverted repeats as the genomic signature in genome analysis.	696
Blockchain and AI-based Solutions to Combat Coronavirus (COVID-19)-like  Epidemics: A Survey	Dinh C. Nguyen,Ming Ding,Pubudu N. Pathirana,Aruna Seneviratne	2021/06/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14631v1	ArXiv	The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of coronavirus outbreak caused by a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2. The sudden explosion and uncontrolled worldwide spread of COVID-19 show the limitations of existing healthcare systems in timely handling public health emergencies. In such contexts, innovative technologies such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as promising solutions for fighting coronavirus epidemic. In particular, blockchain can combat pandemics by enabling early detection of outbreaks, ensuring the ordering of medical data, and ensuring reliable medical supply chain during the outbreak tracing. Moreover, AI provides intelligent solutions for identifying symptoms caused by coronavirus for treatments and supporting drug manufacturing. Therefore, we present an extensive survey on the use of blockchain and AI for combating COVID-19 epidemics. First, we introduce a new conceptual architecture which integrates blockchain and AI for fighting COVID-19. Then, we survey the latest research efforts on the use of blockchain and AI for fighting COVID-19 in various applications. The newly emerging projects and use cases enabled by these technologies to deal with coronavirus pandemic are also presented. A case study is also provided using federated AI for COVID-19 detection. Finally, we point out challenges and future directions that motivate more research efforts to deal with future coronavirus-like epidemics.	697
covLLM: Large Language Models for COVID-19 Biomedical Literature	Yousuf A. Khan,Clarisse Hokia,Jennifer Xu,Ben Ehlert	2023/06/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04926v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic led to 1.1 million deaths in the United States, despite the explosion of coronavirus research. These new findings are slow to translate to clinical interventions, leading to poorer patient outcomes and unnecessary deaths. One reason is that clinicians, overwhelmed by patients, struggle to keep pace with the rate of new coronavirus literature. A potential solution is developing a tool for evaluating coronavirus literature using large language models (LLMs) -- neural networks that are deployed for natural language processing. LLMs can be used to summarize and extract user-specified information. The greater availability and advancement of LLMs and pre-processed coronavirus literature databases provide the opportunity to assist clinicians in evaluating coronavirus literature through a coronavirus literature specific LLM (covLLM), a tool that directly takes an inputted research article and a user query to return an answer. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), we produced two datasets: (1) synCovid, which uses a combination of handwritten prompts and synthetic prompts generated using OpenAI, and (2) real abstracts, which contains abstract and title pairs. covLLM was trained with LLaMA 7B as a baseline model to produce three models trained on (1) the Alpaca and synCovid datasets, (2) the synCovid dataset, and (3) the synCovid and real abstract datasets. These models were evaluated by two human evaluators and ChatGPT. Results demonstrate that training covLLM on the synCovid and abstract pairs datasets performs competitively with ChatGPT and outperforms covLLM trained primarily using the Alpaca dataset.	698
Proposing a fungal metabolite-Flaviolin as a potential inhibitor of  3CLpro of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 using docking and molecular dynamics	Priyashi Rao,Arpit Shukla,Paritosh Parmar,Dweipayan Goswami	2020/04/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03806v1	ArXiv	Here after performing docking and molecular dynamics of various small molecules derived as a secondary metabolite from fungi, we propose Flaviolin to act as potent inhibitor of 3-chymotrypsin (3C) like protease (3CLpro) of noval corona virus SARS-CoV2 responsible for pandemic condition caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).	699
Advertisers Jump on Coronavirus Bandwagon: Politics, News, and Business	Yelena Mejova,Kyriaki Kalimeri	2020/03/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00923v1	ArXiv	"In the age of social media, disasters and epidemics usher not only a devastation and affliction in the physical world, but also prompt a deluge of information, opinions, prognoses and advice to billions of internet users. The coronavirus epidemic of 2019-2020, or COVID-19, is no exception, with the World Health Organization warning of a possible ""infodemic"" of fake news. In this study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians. As we make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain will become an important part of quality control for public health communication and public discourse in general."	700
Coronavirus Perceptions And Economic Anxiety	Thiemo Fetzer,Lukas Hensel,Johannes Hermle,Christopher Roth	2020/03/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03848v4	ArXiv	We provide one of the first systematic assessments of the development and determinants of economic anxiety at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Using a global dataset on internet searches and two representative surveys from the US, we document a substantial increase in economic anxiety during and after the arrival of the coronavirus. We also document a large dispersion in beliefs about the pandemic risk factors of the coronavirus, and demonstrate that these beliefs causally affect individuals' economic anxieties. Finally, we show that individuals' mental models of infectious disease spread understate non-linear growth and shape the extent of economic anxiety.	701
Tracking Social Media Discourse About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development  of a Public Coronavirus Twitter Data Set	Emily Chen,Kristina Lerman,Emilio Ferrara	2020/03/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07372v2	ArXiv	At the time of this writing, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has already put tremendous strain on many countries' citizens, resources and economies around the world. Social distancing measures, travel bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much conversation about these phenomena now occurs online, e.g., on social media platforms like Twitter. In this paper, we describe a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Twitter dataset that we have been continuously collecting since January 22, 2020. We are making our dataset available to the research community (https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs). It is our hope that our contribution will enable the study of online conversation dynamics in the context of a planetary-scale epidemic outbreak of unprecedented proportions and implications. This dataset could also help track scientific coronavirus misinformation and unverified rumors, or enable the understanding of fear and panic -- and undoubtedly more. Ultimately, this dataset may contribute towards enabling informed solutions and prescribing targeted policy interventions to fight this global crisis.	702
Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Analysis of subgenomic mRNA transcription,  3CLpro and PL2pro protease cleavage sites and protein synthesis	Miguel Ramos Pascual	2020/04/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00746v1	ArXiv	Coronaviruses have recently caused world-wide severe outbreaks: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2002 and MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012. At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak appeared in Wuhan (China) seafood market as first focus of infection, becoming a pandemics in 2020, spreading mainly into Europe and Asia. Although the virus family is well-known, this specific virus presents considerable differences, as higher transmission rates, being a challenge for diagnostic methods, treatments and vaccines. Coronavirus(C++).pro is a C++ application which simulates Coronavirus replication cycle. This software has identified virus type in short times and provided FASTA files of virus proteins, a list of mRNA sequences and secondary structures. Furthermore, the software has identified a list of structural, non-structural and accessory proteins in 2019-nCoV virus genome more similar to SARS than to MERS, as several fusion proteins characteristics of this virus type. These results are useful as a first step in order to develop diagnostic methods, new vaccines or antiviral drugs, which could avoid virus replication in any stage: fusion inhibitors, RdRp inhibitors and PL2pro/3CLpro protease inhibitors.	703
Hispidin and Lepidine E: two Natural Compounds and Folic acid as  Potential Inhibitors of 2019-novel coronavirus Main Protease (2019-nCoVMpro),  molecular docking and SAR study	Talia Serseg,Khedidja Benarous,Mohamed Yousfi	2020/04/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08920v1	ArXiv	2019-nCoV is a novel coronavirus was isolated and identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. On 17th February and according to world health organization, a number of 71 429 confirmed cases worldwide, among them 2162 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours. There is no drug or vaccine for human and animal coronavirus. The inhibition of 3CL hydrolase enzyme provides a promising therapeutic principle for developing treatments against CoViD-19. The 3CLpro (Mpro) known for involving in counteracting the host innate immune response. This work presents the inhibitory effect of some natural compounds against 3CL hydrolase enzyme, and explain the main interactions in inhibitor-enzyme complex. Molecular docking study carried out using Autodock Vina. By screening several molecules, we identified three candidate agents that inhibit the main protease of coronavirus. Hispidin, lepidine E, and folic acid bound tightly in the enzyme, strong hydrogen bonds have been formed (1.69-1.80&[Aring]) with the active site residues. This study provides a possible therapeutic strategy for CoViD-19.	704
Isothermal evaporation rate of deposited liquid aerosols and the  SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus survival	P. S. Grinchuk,E. I. Fisenko,S. P. Fisenko,S. M. Danilova-Tretiak	2020/04/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10812v1	ArXiv	It is shown that the evaporation rate of a liquid sample containing the culture of coronavirus affects its survival on a substrate. Possible mechanisms of such influence can be due to the appearance of large, about 140 bar, non comprehensive capillary pressures and the associated dynamic forces during the movement of the evaporation front in a sample with the virus. A simulation of isothermal evaporation of a thin liquid sample based on the Stefan problem was performed. The comparison of simulation data and recent experiments on the coronavirus survival on various surfaces showed that the rate of isothermal evaporation of aqueous samples, which is higher for heat-conducting materials, correlates well with the lifetime of the coronavirus on these surfaces.	705
A Quantitative Portrait of Wikipedia's High-Tempo Collaborations during  the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic	Brian C. Keegan,Chenhao Tan	2020/06/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08899v1	ArXiv	"The 2020 coronavirus pandemic was a historic social disruption with significant consequences felt around the globe. Wikipedia is a freely-available, peer-produced encyclopedia with a remarkable ability to create and revise content following current events. Using 973,940 revisions from 134,337 editors to 4,238 articles, this study examines the dynamics of the English Wikipedia's response to the coronavirus pandemic through the first five months of 2020 as a ""quantitative portrait"" describing the emergent collaborative behavior at three levels of analysis: article revision, editor contributions, and network dynamics. Across multiple data sources, quantitative methods, and levels of analysis, we find four consistent themes characterizing Wikipedia's unique large-scale, high-tempo, and temporary online collaborations: external events as drivers of activity, spillovers of activity, complex patterns of editor engagement, and the shadows of the future. In light of increasing concerns about online social platforms' abilities to govern the conduct and content of their users, we identify implications from Wikipedia's coronavirus collaborations for improving the resilience of socio-technical systems during a crisis."	706
The Coronavirus is a Bioweapon: Analysing Coronavirus Fact-Checked  Stories	Lynnette Hui Xian Ng,Kathleen M. Carley	2021/04/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01215v1	ArXiv	The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has heightened the need to flag coronavirus-related misinformation, and fact-checking groups have taken to verifying misinformation on the Internet. We explore stories reported by fact-checking groups PolitiFact, Poynter and Snopes from January to June 2020, characterising them into six story clusters before then analyse time-series and story validity trends and the level of agreement across sites. We further break down the story clusters into more granular story types by proposing a unique automated method with a BERT classifier, which can be used to classify diverse story sources, in both fact-checked stories and tweets.	707
Impact analysis of recovery cases due to COVID19 using LSTM deep  learning model	Md Ershadul Haque,Samiul Hoque	2022/09/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02173v1	ArXiv	The present world is badly affected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Using medical kits to identify the coronavirus affected persons are very slow. What happens in the next, nobody knows. The world is facing erratic problem and do not know what will happen in near future. This paper is trying to make prognosis of the coronavirus recovery cases using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). This work exploited data of 258 regions, their latitude and longitude and the number of death of 403 days ranging from 22-01-2020 to 27-02-2021. Specifically, advanced deep learning-based algorithms known as the LSTM, play a great effect on extracting highly essential features for time series data (TSD) analysis.There are lots of methods which already use to analyze propagation prediction. The main task of this paper culminates in analyzing the spreading of Coronavirus across worldwide recovery cases using LSTM deep learning-based architectures.	708
The Coronavirus Tradeoff -- Life vs. Economy: Handling the Tradeoff  Rationally and Optimally	Ali Zeytoon-Nejad,Tanzid Hasnain	2022/09/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02651v1	ArXiv	The recent coronavirus outbreak has made governments face an inconvenient tradeoff choice, i.e. the choice between saving lives and saving the economy, forcing them to make immensely consequential decisions among alternative courses of actions without knowing what the ultimate results would be for the society as a whole. This paper attempts to frame the coronavirus tradeoff problem as an economic optimization problem and proposes mathematical optimization methods to make rationally optimal decisions when faced with trade-off situations such as those involved in managing through the recent coronavirus pandemic. The framework introduced and the method proposed in this paper are on the basis of the theory of rational choice at a societal level, which assumes that the government is a rational, benevolent agent that systematically and purposefully takes into account the social marginal costs and social marginal benefits of its actions to its citizens and makes decisions that maximize the society's well-being as a whole. We approach solving this tradeoff problem from a static as well as a dynamic point of view. Finally, we provide several numerical examples clarifying how the proposed framework and methods can be applied in the real-world context.	709
Social Distancing Induced Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVO):  Application to Multimodal Function Optimization and Noise Removal	Om Ramakisan Varma,Mala Kalra	2024/11/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17282v1	ArXiv	The metaheuristic optimization technique attained more awareness for handling complex optimization problems. Over the last few years, numerous optimization techniques have been developed that are inspired by natural phenomena. Recently, the propagation of the new COVID-19 implied a burden on the public health system to suffer several deaths. Vaccination, masks, and social distancing are the major steps taken to minimize the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus. Considering the social distance to combat the coronavirus epidemic, a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization model is proposed in this work, and it is termed as Social Distancing Induced Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVO). The pace of propagation of the coronavirus can indeed be slowed by maintaining social distance. Thirteen benchmark functions are used to evaluate the COVO performance for discrete, continuous, and complex problems, and the COVO model performance is compared with other well-known optimization algorithms. The main motive of COVO optimization is to obtain a global solution to various applications by solving complex problems with faster convergence. At last, the validated results depict that the proposed COVO optimization has a reasonable and acceptable performance.	710
Rapid AI Development Cycle for the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic:  Initial Results for Automated Detection & Patient Monitoring using Deep  Learning CT Image Analysis	Ophir Gozes,Maayan Frid-Adar,Hayit Greenspan,Patrick D. Browning,Huangqi Zhang,Wenbin Ji,Adam Bernheim,Eliot Siegel	2020/03/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05037v3	ArXiv	Purpose: Develop AI-based automated CT image analysis tools for detection, quantification, and tracking of Coronavirus; demonstrate they can differentiate coronavirus patients from non-patients. Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results: Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus as well as quantification and tracking of disease burden.	711
COVID-19 and Mental Health/Substance Use Disorders on Reddit: A  Longitudinal Study	Amanuel Alambo,Swati Padhee,Tanvi Banerjee,Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan	2020/11/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10518v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 pandemic has adversely and disproportionately impacted people suffering from mental health issues and substance use problems. This has been exacerbated by social isolation during the pandemic and the social stigma associated with mental health and substance use disorders, making people reluctant to share their struggles and seek help. Due to the anonymity and privacy they provide, social media emerged as a convenient medium for people to share their experiences about their day to day struggles. Reddit is a well-recognized social media platform that provides focused and structured forums called subreddits, that users subscribe to and discuss their experiences with others. Temporal assessment of the topical correlation between social media postings about mental health/substance use and postings about Coronavirus is crucial to better understand public sentiment on the pandemic and its evolving impact, especially related to vulnerable populations. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal topical analysis of postings between subreddits r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/SuicideWatch, and r/Coronavirus, and postings between subreddits r/opiates, r/OpiatesRecovery, r/addiction, and r/Coronavirus from January 2020 - October 2020. Our results show a high topical correlation between postings in r/depression and r/Coronavirus in September 2020. Further, the topical correlation between postings on substance use disorders and Coronavirus fluctuates, showing the highest correlation in August 2020. By monitoring these trends from platforms such as Reddit, epidemiologists, and mental health professionals can gain insights into the challenges faced by communities for targeted interventions.	712
Predicting potential SARS-CoV-2 spillover and spillback in animals	Zi Hian Tan,Kian Yan Yong,Jian-Jun Shu	2024/08/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09555v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly around the world, causing countries to impose lockdowns and efforts to develop vaccines on a global scale. However, human-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission cannot be ignored, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread rapidly in farmed and wild animals. This could create a worrying cycle of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from humans to animals and spillback of new strains back into humans, rendering vaccines ineffective. This study provides a key indicator of animals that may be potential susceptible hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus infections by analysing the phylogenetic distance between host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the coronavirus spike protein. Crucially, our analysis identifies animals that are at elevated risk from a spillover and spillback incident. One group of animals has been identified as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by harbouring a parasitic coronavirus spike protein similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These animals may serve as amplification hosts in spillover events from zoonotic reservoirs. Tracing interspecies transmission in multi-host environments based solely on in vitro and in vivo examinations of animal susceptibility or serology is a time-consuming task. This approach allows rapid identification of high-risk animals to prioritize research and assessment of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission in the environment. It is a tool to rapidly identify zoonotic species that may cause outbreaks or participate in expansion cycles of coexistence with their hosts. This prevents the spread of coronavirus infections between species, preventing spillover and spillback incidents from occurring.	713
Twitter discussions and emotions about COVID-19 pandemic: a machine  learning approach	Jia Xue,Junxiang Chen,Ran Hu,Chen Chen,ChengDa Zheng,Xiaoqian Liu,Tingshao Zhu	2020/05/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12830v2	ArXiv	"The objective of the study is to examine coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related discussions, concerns, and sentiments that emerged from tweets posted by Twitter users. We analyze 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""quarantine"" from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams include ""virus,"" ""lockdown,"" and ""quarantine."" Popular bigrams include ""COVID-19,"" ""stay home,"" ""corona virus,"" ""social distancing,"" and ""new cases."" We identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into five different themes, such as ""public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" ""social stigma associated with COVID-19,"" ""coronavirus news cases and deaths,"" ""COVID-19 in the United States,"" and ""coronavirus cases in the rest of the world"". Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19. Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be promising for public health emergency responses and planning. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic."	714
A Privacy Preserved and Cost Efficient Control Scheme for Coronavirus  Outbreak Using Call Data Record and Contact Tracing	Shibli Nisar,Syed Muhammad Ali Zuhaib,Abasin Ulasyar,Muhammad Tariq	2020/10/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01521v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus or COVID-19, which has been declared pandemic by the World Health Organization, has incurred huge losses to the lives of people throughout the world. Although, the scientists, researchers and doctors are working round the clock to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, it may take a year or two to make a safe and effective vaccine available for the world. In current circumstances, a solution must be developed to control or stop the spread of the virus. For this purpose, a novel technique based on call data record analysis (CDRA)and contact tracing is proposed that can effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. A positive coronavirus patient can be traced through CDRA and contact tracing. The technique can track the path traversed by the patient and collect the cell numbers of all those people who have met with the patient. Keeping in tact the privacy of this group of people, who are contacted through their cell numbers so that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus test arrives. If a test result of a person comes positive among the group, then he/she must be isolated and same CDRA and contact tracing procedures are adopted for that person. A COVID-19 patient is geo tagged and alerts are sent if any violation of isolation is done by the patient. Moreover, the general public is informed in advance to avoid the path followed by the patients. This cost effective mechanism is not only capable to control the coronavirus outbreak but also helps in isolating the patient in his/her house.	715
SIR Model-based Prediction of Infected Population of Coronavirus in  Hubei Province	Jun Zhang,Lihong Wang,Ji Wang	2020/03/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06419v1	ArXiv	After the sudden outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan, continuous and rich data of the epidemic has been made public as the vital fact for decision support in control measures and aggressive implementation of containment strategies and plans. With the further growth and spreading of the virus, future resource allocation and planning under updated strategies and measures rely on careful study of the epidemic data and characteristics for accurate prediction and estimation. By using the SIR model and reported data, key parameters are obtained from least sum of squared errors for an accurate prediction of epidemic trend in the last four weeks.	716
Coronavirus: Case for Digital Money?	Zura Kakushadze,Jim Kyung-Soo Liew	2020/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10154v1	ArXiv	We discuss the pros of adopting government-issued digital currencies as well as a supranational digital iCurrency. One such pro is to get rid of paper money (and coinage), a ubiquitous medium for spreading germs, as highlighted by the recent coronavirus outbreak. We set forth three policy recommendations for adapting mobile devices as new digital wallets, regulatory oversight of sovereign digital currencies and user data protection, and a supranational digital iCurrency for facilitating international digital monetary linkages.	717
A structural model for the Coronavirus Nucleocapsid	Federico Coscio,Alejandro D. Nadra,Diego U. Ferreiro	2020/05/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12165v1	ArXiv	We propose a mesoscale model structure for the coronavirus nucleocapsid, assembled from the high resolution structures of the basic building blocks of the N-protein, CryoEM imaging and mathematical constraints for an overall quasi-spherical particle. The structure is a truncated octahedron that accommodates two layers: an outer shell composed of triangular and quadrangular lattices of the N-terminal domain and an inner shell of equivalent lattices of coiled parallel helices of the C-terminal domain. The model is consistent with the dimensions expected for packaging large viral genomes and provides a rationale to interpret the apparent pleomorphic nature of coronaviruses.	718
The Impact of COVID-19 on Stock Market Volatility in Pakistan	Ateeb Akhter Shah Syed,Kaneez Fatima	2021/02/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03219v1	ArXiv	This paper examines the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on stock market volatility (SMV) in Pakistan by controlling the effect of exchange rate, interest rate and government/central bank interventions to combat the pandemic. We used the vector autoregressive (VAR) model over a sample period ranging from February 25, 2020 to December 7, 2020. We find that a shock to total daily coronavirus cases in Pakistan lead to a significant increase in SMV. This result is aligned with a vast literature on pandemics and investors uncertainty and remains robust to several robustness checks applied in our analysis.	719
Asymptomatic Phase and Convergent Evolution of Coronavirus	J. C. Phillips	2021/03/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07471v1	ArXiv	CoV2019 has evolved to be much more dangerous than CoV2003. Experiments suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of four single mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally. The theory also works well for the newer strains and explains their increased contagiousness.	720
First attempts to model the dynamics of the Coronavirus outbreak 2020	Thomas Götz	2020/02/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03821v1	ArXiv	Since the end of 2019 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, called 2019--nCoV, is reported from China and later other parts of the world. Since January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from both China and other countries. In this work we present some discrete and continuous models to discribe the disease dynamics in China and estimate the needed epidemiological parameters. Good agreement with the current dynamics has be found for both a discrete transmission model and a slightly modified SIR-model.	721
Forecast of the evolution of the contagious disease caused by novel  coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China	Javier Gamero,Juan A. Tamayo,Juan A. Martinez-Roman	2020/02/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04739v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has caused a viral epidemic affecting tens of thousands of persons. Though the danger of this epidemic is evident, the statistical analysis of data offered in this paper indicates that the increase in new cases in China will stabilize in the coming days or weeks. Our forecast could serve to evaluate risks and control the evolution of this disease.	722
A mathematical model for the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak	Roman Cherniha,Vasyl' Davydovych	2020/04/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01487v2	ArXiv	A mathematical model is proposed for quantitative description of the outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in China. Although the model is relatively simple, the comparison with the public data shows that an exact solution solution of the model (with the correctly-specified parameters) leads to the results, which are in good agreement with the measured data. Prediction of the total number of the COVID-19 cases is discussed and an example is presented using the measured data in Austria.	723
A Mathematical Description of the Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease  (COVID-19): A Case Study of Brazil	Pedro V. Savi,Marcelo A. Savi,Beatriz Borges	2020/04/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03495v2	ArXiv	This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and numerical simulations related to the coronavirus dynamics. A description is developed based on the framework of susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model. Initially, a model verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China, Italy, Iran and Brazil. Afterward, numerical simulations are performed to analyzed different scenarios of COVID-19 in Brazil. Results show the importance of governmental and individual actions to control the number and the period of the critical situations related to the pandemic.	724
Assessing the Efficiency of Different Control Strategies for the  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Epidemic	César Castilho,João A. M. Gondim,Marcelo Marchesin,Mehran Sabeti	2020/04/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03539v1	ArXiv	The goal of this work is to analyse the effects of control policies for the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Brazil. This is done by considering an age-structured SEIR model with a quarantine class and two types of controls. The first one studies the sensitivity with regard to the parameters of the basic reproductive number R0 which is calculated by the next generation method. The second one evaluates different quarantine strategies by comparing their relative total number of deaths.	725
SEI1I2HRSVM model applied to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in  Paraguay	Juan A. Gonzalez Cuevas	2020/06/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00926v1	ArXiv	In the present article a mathematical model is proposed to research the current coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) in Paraguay, describing the multiple transmission paths in the infection dynamics, following the susceptible, exposed, infectious, hospitalized, with lost immunity and recovered individuals, as well as the role of the virus in the environment and deaths from COVID-19 or other reasons. In order to reflect the impact of the control measures adopted by the government and the population, the model employs variable transmission rates that change with the epidemiological status and environmental conditions. The model is validated, and its application is demonstrated with data publicly available.	726
Lest We Forget: A Dataset of Coronavirus-Related News Headlines in Swiss  Media	Alireza Ghasemi,Amina Chebira	2020/06/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16967v1	ArXiv	We release our COVID-19 news dataset, containing more than 10,000 links to news articles related to the Coronavirus pandemic published in the Swiss media since early January 2020. This collection can prove beneficial in mining and analysis of the reaction of the Swiss media and the COVID-19 pandemic and extracting insightful information for further research. We hope this dataset helps researchers and the public deliver results that will help analyse the pandemic and potentially lead to a better understanding of the events.	727
Initial Impacts of COVID-19 on Transportation Systems: A Case Study of  the U.S. Epicenter, the New York Metropolitan Area	Jingqin Gao,Suzana Duran Bernardes,Zilin Bian,Kaan Ozbay,Shri Iyer	2020/10/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01168v1	ArXiv	The novel Coronavirus COVID-19 spreading rapidly throughout the world was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. One month into the COVID-19 pandemic, this white paper looks at the initial impacts COVID-19 has had on transportation systems in the metropolitan area of New York, which has become the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus.	728
A Vector Autoregression Prediction Model for COVID-19 Outbreak	Qinan Wang,Yaomu Zhou,Xiaofei Chen	2021/02/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04843v1	ArXiv	Since two people came down a county of north Seattle with positive COVID-19 (coronavirus-19) in 2019, the current total cases in the United States (U.S.) are over 12 million. Predicting the pandemic trend under effective variables is crucial to help find a way to control the epidemic. Based on available literature, we propose a validated Vector Autoregression (VAR) time series model to predict the positive COVID-19 cases. A real data prediction for U.S. is provided based on the U.S. coronavirus data. The key message from our study is that the situation of the pandemic will getting worse if there is no effective control.	729
From Omicron to Its BA.5 Subvariant: A New Twist in Coronavirus  Contagiousness Evolution	J. C. Phillips	2022/08/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04956v1	ArXiv	In 2022 new subvariants of Coronavirus appeared in South Africa, and spread rapidly to other parts of the world. The effects of selective evolution on increasing the already high contagiousness of CoV19 up to Omicron were previously discussed with high accuracy using concepts new to molecular biology (from mathematics and physics) that have been developed over the last few decades. Here we discuss the new subvariants, and find novel features successfully combining both improved flexibility and improved stability.	730
Spatiotemporal fluctuation scaling law and metapopulation modeling of  the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks	Zhanshan Ma	2020/03/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03714v1	ArXiv	We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological characteristics. Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions.	731
The Second Worldwide Wave of Interest in Coronavirus since the COVID-19  Outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran: A Google Trends Study	Artur Strzelecki	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10998v3	ArXiv	The recent emergence of a new coronavirus, COVID-19, has gained extensive coverage in public media and global news. As of 24 March 2020, the virus has caused viral pneumonia in tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, China, and thousands of cases in 184 other countries and territories. This study explores the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this COVID-19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given the interest in the topic. Current data on COVID-19 is retrieved from (GT) using one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are worldwide, China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. The reported period is 15 January 2020 to 24 March 2020. The results show that the highest worldwide peak in the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy, with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as the first wave. The number of new cases reported daily is rising day by day. This short communication gives a brief introduction to how the demand for information on coronavirus epidemic is reported through GT.	732
In-silico nucleotide and protein analyses of S-gene region in selected  zoonotic coronaviruses reveal conserved domains and evolutionary emergence  with trajectory course of viral entry from SARS-CoV2 genomic data	Adejoke Olukayode Obajuluwa,Pius Abimbola Okiki,Tiwalola Madoc Obajuluwa,Olakunle Bamikole Afolabi	2020/05/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02809v1	ArXiv	The recent zoonotic coronavirus virus outbreak of a novel type [COVID 19] has necessitated the adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic viruses which adversely affects human populations for therapeutic constructs to combat the pandemic now and in the future. We analyzed conserved domains of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for possible targets of viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed between Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines as early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.	733
COVID-19 Public Sentiment Insights and Machine Learning for Tweets  Classification	Jim Samuel,G. G. Md. Nawaz Ali,Md. Mokhlesur Rahman,Ek Esawi,Yana Samuel	2020/05/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10898v1	ArXiv	Along with the Coronavirus pandemic, another crisis has manifested itself in the form of mass fear and panic phenomena, fueled by incomplete and often inaccurate information. There is therefore a tremendous need to address and better understand COVID-19's informational crisis and gauge public sentiment, so that appropriate messaging and policy decisions can be implemented. In this research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Naive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets. This research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment progression, and outlines associated methods, implications, limitations and opportunities.	734
Power of Artificial Intelligence to Diagnose and Prevent Further  COVID-19 Outbreak: A Short Communication	Muhammad Lawan Jibril,Usman Sani Sharif	2020/04/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12463v1	ArXiv	Novel coronavirus-19 (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) is by far the most dangerous coronavirus ever identified for the third time in the three decades capable of infecting not only the animals but also the humans across the globe. Nearly 6000 deaths have been recorded due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and more than 50% of these deaths appeared to have evolved from China where the virus was thought to originate. The endemicity of COVID-19 dramatically surpassed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were so far discovered in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak not only a public health emergency but also pandemic in nature. Currently, over 120 countries including Nigeria were reported to have more than 157,844 confirmed cases and 5,846 deaths due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak as of March 15, 2020, 10:55 GMT. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used to aid in the prediction, detection, response, recovery of disease and making clinical diagnosis. In this study, we highlighted the power of AI in the containment and mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 outbreak in African countries such as Nigeria where human to human contact is apparently inevitable.	735
Understanding the Diverging User Trajectories in Highly-related Online  Communities during the COVID-19 Pandemic	Jason Shuo Zhang,Brian C. Keegan,Qin Lv,Chenhao Tan	2020/06/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04816v2	ArXiv	"As the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting life worldwide, related online communities are popping up. In particular, two ""new"" communities, /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus, emerged on Reddit and have been dedicated to COVID- related discussions from the very beginning of this pandemic. With /r/Coronavirus promoted as the official community on Reddit, it remains an open question how users choose between these two highly-related communities.   In this paper, we characterize user trajectories in these two communities from the beginning of COVID-19 to the end of September 2020. We show that new users of /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus were similar from January to March. After that, their differences steadily increase, evidenced by both language distance and membership prediction, as the pandemic continues to unfold. Furthermore, users who started at /r/China flu from January to March were more likely to leave, while those who started in later months tend to remain highly ""loyal"". To understand this difference, we develop a movement analysis framework to understand membership changes in these two communities and identify a significant proportion of /r/China flu members (around 50%) that moved to /r/Coronavirus in February. This movement turns out to be highly predictable based on other subreddits that users were previously active in. Our work demonstrates how two highly-related communities emerge and develop their own identity in a crisis, and highlights the important role of existing communities in understanding such an emergence."	736
Global Sentiment Analysis Of COVID-19 Tweets Over Time	Muvazima Mansoor,Kirthika Gurumurthy,Anantharam R U,V R Badri Prasad	2020/10/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14234v2	ArXiv	The Coronavirus pandemic has affected the normal course of life. People around the world have taken to social media to express their opinions and general emotions regarding this phenomenon that has taken over the world by storm. The social networking site, Twitter showed an unprecedented increase in tweets related to the novel Coronavirus in a very short span of time. This paper presents the global sentiment analysis of tweets related to Coronavirus and how the sentiment of people in different countries has changed over time. Furthermore, to determine the impact of Coronavirus on daily aspects of life, tweets related to Work From Home (WFH) and Online Learning were scraped and the change in sentiment over time was observed. In addition, various Machine Learning models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were implemented for sentiment classification and their accuracies were determined. Exploratory data analysis was also performed for a dataset providing information about the number of confirmed cases on a per-day basis in a few of the worst-hit countries to provide a comparison between the change in sentiment with the change in cases since the start of this pandemic till June 2020.	737
One-Year In: COVID-19 Research at the International Level in CORD-19  Data	Caroline S. Wagner,Xiaojing Cai,Yi Zhang,Caroline V. Fry	2022/02/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03202v1	ArXiv	The appearance of a novel coronavirus in late 2019 radically changed the community of researchers working on coronaviruses since the 2002 SARS epidemic. In 2020, coronavirus-related publications grew by 20 times over the previous two years, with 130,000 more researchers publishing on related topics. The United States, the United Kingdom and China led dozens of nations working on coronavirus prior to the pandemic, but leadership consolidated among these three nations in 2020, which collectively accounted for 50% of all papers, garnering well more than 60% of citations. China took an early lead on COVID-19 research, but dropped rapidly in production and international participation through the year. Europe showed an opposite pattern, beginning slowly in publications but growing in contributions during the year. The share of internationally collaborative publications dropped from pre-pandemic rates; single-authored publications grew. For all nations, including China, the number of publications about COVID track closely with the outbreak of COVID-19 cases. Lower-income nations participate very little in COVID-19 research in 2020. Topic maps of internationally collaborative work show the rise of patient care and public health clusters, two topics that were largely absent from coronavirus research in the two years prior to 2020. Findings are consistent with global science as a self-organizing system operating on a reputation-based dynamic.	738
COVID-19 Docking Server: A meta server for docking small molecules,  peptides and antibodies against potential targets of COVID-19	Ren Kong,Guangbo Yang,Rui Xue,Ming Liu,Feng Wang,Jianping Hu,Xiaoqiang Guo,Shan Chang	2020/02/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00163v2	ArXiv	Motivation: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and led to thousands of death globally since December 2019. Despite many groups have engaged in studying the newly emerged virus and searching for the treatment of COVID-19, the understanding of the COVID-19 target-ligand interactions represents a key chal-lenge. Herein, we introduce COVID-19 Docking Server, a web server that predicts the binding modes between COVID-19 targets and the ligands including small molecules, peptides and anti-bodies. Results: Structures of proteins involved in the virus life cycle were collected or constructed based on the homologs of coronavirus, and prepared ready for docking. The meta platform provides a free and interactive tool for the prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and following drug discovery for COVID-19.	739
Coronavirus and oil price crash	Claudiu Albulescu	2020/03/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06184v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus (COVID-19) creates fear and uncertainty, hitting the global economy and amplifying the financial markets volatility. The oil price reaction to COVID-19 was gradually accommodated until March 09, 2020, when, 49 days after the release of the first coronavirus monitoring report by the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia floods the market with oil. As a result, international prices drop with more than 20% in one single day. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 numbers on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of financial volatility and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty. Our ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily reported cases of new infections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the long run. Nevertheless, by amplifying the financial markets volatility, COVID-19 also has an indirect effect on the recent dynamics of crude oil prices.	740
Day Level Forecasting for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Spread:  Analysis, Modeling and Recommendations	Haytham H. Elmousalami,Aboul Ella Hassanien	2020/03/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07778v1	ArXiv	In mid of March 2020, Coronaviruses such as COVID-19 is declared as an international epidemic. More than 125000 confirmed cases and 4,607 death cases have been recorded around more than 118 countries. Unfortunately, a coronavirus vaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover, COVID -19 epidemics can mutate into a more aggressive form. Day level information about the COVID -19 spread is crucial to measure the behavior of this new virus globally. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of day level forecasting models on COVID-19 affected cases using time series models and mathematical formulation. The forecasting models and data strongly suggest that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (Social Distancing).	741
Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: methods and implications	Changchuan Yin	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10965v1	ArXiv	The emerging global infectious COVID-19 coronavirus disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.	742
Infodemiological Study Using Google Trends on Coronavirus Epidemic in  Wuhan, China	Artur Strzelecki,Mariia Rizun	2020/01/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11021v3	ArXiv	The recent emergence of a new coronavirus (COVID-19) has gained a high cover in public media and worldwide news. The virus has caused a viral pneumonia in tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, a central city of China. This short paper gives a brief introduction on how the demand for information on this new epidemic is reported through Google Trends. The reported period is 31 December 2020 to 20 March 2020. The authors draw conclusions on current infodemiological data on COVID-19 using three main search keywords: coronavirus, SARS and MERS. Two approaches are set. First is the worldwide perspective, second - the Chinese one, which reveals that in China this disease in the first days was more often referred to SARS then to general coronaviruses, whereas worldwide, since the beginning, it is more often referred to coronaviruses.	743
Viral Visualizations: How Coronavirus Skeptics Use Orthodox Data  Practices to Promote Unorthodox Science Online	Crystal Lee,Tanya Yang,Gabrielle Inchoco,Graham M. Jones,Arvind Satyanarayan	2021/01/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07993v1	ArXiv	Controversial understandings of the coronavirus pandemic have turned data visualizations into a battleground. Defying public health officials, coronavirus skeptics on US social media spent much of 2020 creating data visualizations showing that the government's pandemic response was excessive and that the crisis was over. This paper investigates how pandemic visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of data-driven decision-making used by experts, but to advocate for radical policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro- and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in public life.	744
Towards New Multiwavelets: Associated Filters and Algorithms. Part I:  Theoretical Framework and Investigation of Biomedical Signals, ECG and  Coronavirus Cases	Malika Jallouli,Makerem Zemni,Anouar Ben Mabrouk,Mohamed Ali Mahjoub	2021/03/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08657v1	ArXiv	Biosignals are nowadays important subjects for scientific researches from both theory and applications especially with the appearance of new pandemics threatening humanity such as the new Coronavirus. One aim in the present work is to prove that Wavelets may be successful machinery to understand such phenomena by applying a step forward extension of wavelets to multiwavelets. We proposed in a first step to improve the multiwavelet notion by constructing more general families using independent components for multi-scaling and multiwavelet mother functions. A special multiwavelet is then introduced, continuous and discrete multiwavelet transforms are associated, as well as new filters and algorithms of decomposition and reconstruction. The constructed multiwavelet framework is applied for some experimentations showing fast algorithms, ECG signal, and a strain of Coronavirus processing.	745
Mathematical Modeling of the Spread of COVID-19 in Moscow and Russian  Regions	E. M. Koltsova,E. S. Kurkina,A. M. Vasetsky	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10118v1	ArXiv	To model the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Russian regions and in Moscow, a discrete logistic equation describing the increase in the number of cases is used. To check the adequacy of the mathematical model, the simulation results were compared with the spread of coronavirus in China, in a number of European and Asian countries, and the United States. The parameters of the logistics equation for Russia, Moscow and other large regions were determined in the interval (01.03 - 08.04). A comparative analysis of growth rates of COVID-19 infected population for different countries and regions is presented. Various scenarios of the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Moscow and in the regions of Russia are considered. For each scenario, curves for the daily new cases and graphs for the increase in the total number of cases were obtained, and the dynamics of infection spread by day was studied. Peak times, epidemic periods, the number of infected people at the peak and their growth were determined.	746
A First Instagram Dataset on COVID-19	Koosha Zarei,Reza Farahbakhsh,Noel Crespi,Gareth Tyson	2020/04/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12226v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak is drastically shaping and reshaping many aspects of our life, with a huge impact on our social life. In this era of lockdown policies in most of the major cities around the world, we see a huge increase in people and professional engagement in social media. Social media is playing an important role in news propagation as well as keeping people in contact. At the same time, this source is both a blessing and a curse as the coronavirus infodemic has become a major concern, and is already a topic that needs special attention and further research. In this paper, we provide a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Instagram dataset that we have been continuously collected since March 30, 2020. We are making our dataset available to the research community at Github. We believe that this contribution will help the community to better understand the dynamics behind this phenomenon in Instagram, as one of the major social media. This dataset could also help study the propagation of misinformation related to this outbreak.	747
Dinucleotide repeats in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome: evolutionary  implications	Changchuan Yin	2020/05/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00280v1	ArXiv	The ongoing global pandemic of infection disease COVID-19 caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2, formerly 2019-nCoV) presents critical threats to public health and the economy since it was identified in China, December 2019. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been sequenced and structurally annotated, yet little is known of the intrinsic organization and evolution of the genome. To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the dinucleotide regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. The special dinucleotide regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified in this study may become diagnostic and pharmaceutical targets in monitoring and curing the COVID-19 disease.	748
Deep Learning Models for Early Detection and Prediction of the spread of  Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)	Devante Ayris,Kye Horbury,Blake Williams,Mitchell Blackney,Celine Shi Hui See,Maleeha Imtiaz,Syed Afaq Ali Shah	2020/07/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01170v2	ArXiv	SARS-CoV2, which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is continuing to spread globally and has become a pandemic. People have lost their lives due to the virus and the lack of counter measures in place. Given the increasing caseload and uncertainty of spread, there is an urgent need to develop machine learning techniques to predict the spread of COVID-19. Prediction of the spread can allow counter measures and actions to be implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, called Deep Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM) and machine learning based Non-parametric Regression Model (NRM) to predict the spread of COVID-19. Our proposed models were trained and tested on novel coronavirus 2019 dataset, which contains 19.53 Million confirmed cases of COVID-19. Our proposed models were evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error and compared with baseline method. Our experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the superior prediction performance of the proposed models.	749
Tetracycline as an inhibitor to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2	Tom Y. Zhao,Neelesh A. Patankar	2020/08/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06034v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 remains an extant threat against public health on a global scale. Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Doxycycline-RBD). Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears to target viral residues that are usually involved in significant hydrogen bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may further reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.	750
Global health science leverages established collaboration network to  fight COVID-19	Stefano Bianchini,Moritz Müller,Pierre Pelletier,Kevin Wirtz	2021/01/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00298v1	ArXiv	"How has the science system reacted to the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic? Here we compare the (growing) international network for coronavirus research with the broader international health science network. Our findings show that, before the outbreak, coronavirus research realized a relatively small and rather peculiar niche within the global health sciences. As a response to the pandemic, the international network for coronavirus research expanded rapidly along the hierarchical structure laid out by the global health science network. Thus, in face of the crisis, the global health science system proved to be structurally stable yet versatile in research. The observed versatility supports optimistic views on the role of science in meeting future challenges. However, the stability of the global core-periphery structure may be worrying, because it reduces learning opportunities and social capital of scientifically peripheral countries -- not only during this pandemic but also in its ""normal"" mode of operation."	751
Real-time tracking of COVID-19 and coronavirus research updates through  text mining	Yutong Jin,Jie Li,Xinyu Wang,Peiyao Li,Jinjiang Guo,Junfeng Wu,Dawei Leng,Lurong Pan	2021/02/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07640v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic. There are ongoing studies with up to hundreds of publications uploaded to databases daily. We are exploring the use-case of artificial intelligence and natural language processing in order to efficiently sort through these publications. We demonstrate that clinical trial information, preclinical studies, and a general topic model can be used as text mining data intelligence tools for scientists all over the world to use as a resource for their own research. To evaluate our method, several metrics are used to measure the information extraction and clustering results. In addition, we demonstrate that our workflow not only have a use-case for COVID-19, but for other disease areas as well. Overall, our system aims to allow scientists to more efficiently research coronavirus. Our automatically updating modules are available on our information portal at https://ghddi-ailab.github.io/Targeting2019-nCoV/ for public viewing.	752
Oil-US Stock Market Nexus: Some insights about the New Coronavirus  Crisis	Claudiu Albulescu,Michel Mina,Cornel Oros	2021/04/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05273v1	ArXiv	We provide a new investigation of the relationship between oil and stock prices in the context of the outbreak of the new coronavirus crisis. Specifically, we assess to what extent the uncertainty induced by COVID-19 affects the interaction between oil and the United States (US) stock markets. To this end, we use a wavelet approach and daily data from February 18, 2020 to August 15, 2020. We identify the lead-lag relationship between oil and stock prices, and the intensity of this relationship at different frequency cycles and moments in time. Our unique findings show that co-movements between oil and stock prices manifest at 3-5-day cycle and are stronger in the first part of March and the second part of April 2020, when oil prices are leading stock prices. The partial wavelet coherence analysis, controlling for the effect of COVID-19 and US economic policy-induced uncertainty, reveals that the coronavirus crisis amplifies the shock propagation between oil and stock prices.	753
3D RegNet: Deep Learning Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis on Chest CT Image	Haibo Qi,Yuhan Wang,Xinyu Liu	2021/07/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04055v1	ArXiv	In this paper, a 3D-RegNet-based neural network is proposed for diagnosing the physical condition of patients with coronavirus (Covid-19) infection. In the application of clinical medicine, lung CT images are utilized by practitioners to determine whether a patient is infected with coronavirus. However, there are some laybacks can be considered regarding to this diagnostic method, such as time consuming and low accuracy. As a relatively large organ of human body, important spatial features would be lost if the lungs were diagnosed utilizing two dimensional slice image. Therefore, in this paper, a deep learning model with 3D image was designed. The 3D image as input data was comprised of two-dimensional pulmonary image sequence and from which relevant coronavirus infection 3D features were extracted and classified. The results show that the test set of the 3D model, the result: f1 score of 0.8379 and AUC value of 0.8807 have been achieved.	754
Analyzing the Data of COVID-19 with Quasi-Distribution Fitting Based on  Piecewise B-spline Curves	Qingliang Zhao,Zhenhuan Lu,Yiduo Wang	2021/10/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13391v1	ArXiv	Facing the world wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a new fitting method (QDF, quasi-distribution fitting) which could be used to analyze the data of COVID-19 is developed based on piecewise quasi-uniform B-spline curves. For any given country or district, it simulates the distribution histogram data which is made from the daily confirmed cases (or the other data including daily recovery cases and daily fatality cases) of the COVID-19 with piecewise quasi-uniform B-spline curves. Being dealt with area normalization method, the fitting curves could be regarded as a kind of probability density function (PDF), its mathematical expectation and the variance could be used to analyze the situation of the coronavirus pandemic. Numerical experiments based on the data of certain countries have indicated that the QDF method demonstrate the intrinsic characteristics of COVID-19 data of the given country or distric, and because of the interval of data used in this paper is over one year (500 days), it reveals the fact that after multi-wave transmission of the coronavirus, the case fatality rate has declined obviously, the result shows that as an appraisal method, it is effective and feasible.	755
Invariant in variants	Cong Liu,Chen-Wu Wu	2021/11/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13068v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus Covid-19 mutates quickly in the pandemic, leaves people struggling to verify and improve the effectiveness of the vaccine based on biochemistry. Is there any physical invariant in the variants of such kind of pathogen that could be taken advantage to ease the tensions? To this point, extensive numerical experiments based on continuity mechanics were carried out to discover the vibration modes and the range of natural frequency of coronavirus Covid-19. Such invariant could help us in developing some flexible technique to deactivate the coronavirus, like as resonantly breaking the viral spike by ultrasound wave. The fundamental mechanisms governing such process are demonstrated via solving the coupled equations of acoustics and dynamics and thereafter the technique strategies proposed to efficiently realize the concept.	756
Efficient Classification of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Sequences Using Federated  Learning	Prakash Chourasia,Taslim Murad,Zahra Tayebi,Sarwan Ali,Imdad Ullah Khan,Murray Patterson	2023/02/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08688v2	ArXiv	This paper presents a federated learning (FL) approach to train an AI model for SARS-Cov-2 variant classification. We analyze the SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences in a distributed way, without data sharing, to detect different variants of this rapidly mutating coronavirus. Our method maintains the confidentiality of local data (that could be stored in different locations) yet allows us to reliably detect and identify different known and unknown variants of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Using the proposed approach, we achieve an overall accuracy of $93\%$ on the coronavirus variant identification task. We also provide details regarding how the proposed model follows the main laws of federated learning, such as Laws of data ownership, data privacy, model aggregation, and model heterogeneity. Since the proposed model is distributed, it could scale on ``Big Data'' easily. We plan to use this proof-of-concept to implement a privacy-preserving pandemic response strategy.	757
CVR-Net: A deep convolutional neural network for coronavirus recognition  from chest radiography images	Md. Kamrul Hasan,Md. Ashraful Alam,Md. Toufick E Elahi,Shidhartho Roy,Sifat Redwan Wahid	2020/07/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11993v1	ArXiv	The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic disease spreading rapidly around the world. A robust and automatic early recognition of COVID-19, via auxiliary computer-aided diagnostic tools, is essential for disease cure and control. The chest radiography images, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray, and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be a significant and useful material for designing such tools. However, designing such an automated tool is challenging as a massive number of manually annotated datasets are not publicly available yet, which is the core requirement of supervised learning systems. In this article, we propose a robust CNN-based network, called CVR-Net (Coronavirus Recognition Network), for the automatic recognition of the coronavirus from CT or X-ray images. The proposed end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model, where we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test the proposed CVR-Net on three different datasets, where the images have collected from different open-source repositories. We compare our proposed CVR-Net with state-of-the-art methods, which are trained and tested on the same datasets. We split three datasets into five different tasks, where each task has a different number of classes, to evaluate the multi-tasking CVR-Net. Our model achieves an overall F1-score & accuracy of 0.997 & 0.998; 0.963 & 0.964; 0.816 & 0.820; 0.961 & 0.961; and 0.780 & 0.780, respectively, for task-1 to task-5. As the CVR-Net provides promising results on the small datasets, it can be an auspicious computer-aided diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of coronavirus to assist the clinical practitioners and radiologists. Our source codes and model are publicly available at https://github.com/kamruleee51/CVR-Net.	758
Estimating Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Ohio: A Bayesian Multilevel  Poststratification Approach with Multiple Diagnostic Tests	David Kline,Zehang Li,Yue Chu,Jon Wakefield,William C. Miller,Abigail Norris Turner,Samuel J Clark	2020/11/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09033v2	ArXiv	Globally the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has infected more than 59 million people and killed more than 1.39 million. Designing and monitoring interventions to slow and stop the spread of the virus require knowledge of how many people have been and are currently infected, where they live, and how they interact. The first step is an accurate assessment of the population prevalence of past infections. There are very few population-representative prevalence studies of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and only two American states -- Indiana and Connecticut -- have reported probability-based sample surveys that characterize state-wide prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. One of the difficulties is the fact that the tests to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibodies are new, not well characterized, and generally function poorly. During July, 2020, a survey representing all adults in the State of Ohio in the United States collected biomarkers and information on protective behavior related to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Several features of the survey make it difficult to estimate past prevalence: 1) a low response rate, 2) very low number of positive cases, and 3) the fact that multiple, poor quality serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We describe a new Bayesian approach for analyzing the biomarker data that simultaneously addresses these challenges and characterizes the potential effect of selective response. The model does not require survey sample weights, accounts for multiple, imperfect antibody test results, and characterizes uncertainty related to the sample survey and the multiple, imperfect, potentially correlated tests.	759
SARS-CoV-2 Entry Genes Are Most Highly Expressed in Nasal Goblet and  Ciliated Cells within Human Airways	Waradon Sungnak,Ni Huang,Christophe Bécavin,Marijn Berg,HCA Lung Biological Network	2020/03/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06122v1	ArXiv	The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID-19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.	760
Automatic Detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Using X-ray Images  and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks	Ali Narin,Ceren Kaya,Ziynet Pamuk	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10849v3	ArXiv	The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with a starting point in China, has spread rapidly among people living in other countries, and is approaching approximately 34,986,502 cases worldwide according to the statistics of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. There are a limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing cases daily. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. In this study, five pre-trained convolutional neural network based models (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. We have implemented three different binary classifications with four classes (COVID-19, normal (healthy), viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia) by using 5-fold cross validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it has seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance (96.1% accuracy for Dataset-1, 99.5% accuracy for Dataset-2 and 99.7% accuracy for Dataset-3) among other four used models.	761
Statistical investigation of relationship between spread of coronavirus  disease (COVID-19) and environmental factors based on study of four mostly  affected places of China and five mostly affected places of Italy	Soumyabrata Bhattacharjee	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11277v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus disease which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It originated in China in the month of December 2019 and quickly started to spread within the country. On 31st December 2019, it was first reported to country office of World Health Organization (WHO) in China. Since then, it has spread to most of the countries around the globe. However, there has been a recent rise in trend in believing that it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been properly investigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity (RH_max), maximum temperature (T_max) and highest wind speed (WS_max), considering the incubation period, have been investigated statistically, for four of the most affected places of China, viz. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz. Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum relative humidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with maximum temperature is ranging between negligible to moderate.	762
Distant sequence similarity between hepcidin and the novel coronavirus  spike glycoprotein: a potential hint at the possibility of local iron  dysregulation in COVID-19	Sepehr Ehsani	2020/03/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12191v3	ArXiv	The spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has attracted attention for its vaccine potential and binding capacity to host cell surface receptors. Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain of the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region, followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation in the coronavirus research field making use of an already-established literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and the hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this report, but some scenarios for its study are discussed.	763
SARS-CoV-2 mortality in blacks and temperature-sensitivity to an  angiotensin-2 receptor blocker	Donald R. Forsdyke	2020/04/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01579v5	ArXiv	Tropical climates provoke adaptations in skin pigmentation and in mechanisms controlling the volume, salt-content and pressure of body fluids. For many whose distant ancestors moved to temperate climes, these adaptations proved harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection and susceptibility to hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from coronavirus that may be furthered by innate immune differences. Hypertension and coronavirus have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which decreases blood pressure and mediates virus entry. In keeping with less detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that decreased blood pressure induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented, above critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely mediated by ACE2 and secondary angiotensin receptors. Temperature-dependence suggests a linkage with tropical heritage and an influence of blockers on the progress of coronavirus infections. Positive therapeutic results should result from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the primary angiotensin receptor and concomitant promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. These effects may involve innate immune system components (lectin complement pathway, NAD metabolome). Black vulnerability - more likely based on physiological than on socioeconomic differences - provides an important clue that may guide treatments.	764
E-Quarantine: A Smart Health System for Monitoring Coronavirus Patients  for Remotely Quarantine	Doaa Mohey El-Din,Aboul Ella Hassanein,Ehab E. Hassanien,Walaa M. E. Hussein	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04187v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus becomes officially a global pandemic due to the speed spreading off in various countries. An increasing number of infected with this disease causes the Inability problem to fully care in hospitals and afflict many doctors and nurses inside the hospitals. This paper proposes a smart health system that monitors the patients holding the Coronavirus remotely. Due to protect the lives of the health services members (like physicians and nurses) from infection. This smart system observes the people with this disease based on putting many sensors to record many features of their patients in every second. These parameters include measuring the patient's temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, and time. The proposed system saves lives and improves making decisions in dangerous cases. It proposes using artificial intelligence and Internet-of-things to make remotely quarantine and develop decisions in various situations. It provides monitoring patients remotely and guarantees giving patients medicines and getting complete health care without anyone getting sick with this disease. It targets two people's slides the most serious medical conditions and infection and the lowest serious medical conditions in their houses. Observing in hospitals for the most serious medical cases that cause infection in thousands of healthcare members so there is a big need to uses it. Other less serious patients slide, this system enables physicians to monitor patients and get the healthcare from patient's houses to save places for the critical cases in hospitals.	765
The effect of messaging and gender on intentions to wear a face covering  to slow down COVID-19 transmission	Valerio Capraro,Hélène Barcelo	2020/05/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05467v1	ArXiv	"Now that various countries are or will soon be moving towards relaxing shelter-in-place rules, it is important that people use a face covering, to avoid an exponential resurgence of the spreading of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Here we report a pre-registered online experiment (N=2,459) using a heterogenous, although not representative, sample of people living in the USA, where we test the relative effect of messages highlighting that the coronavirus is a threat to ""you"" vs ""your family"" vs ""your community"" vs ""your country"" on self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results show that focusing on ""your community"" promotes intentions to wear a face covering relative to the baseline; the trend is the same when comparing ""your community"" to the other conditions, but not significant. We also conducted pre-registered analyses of gender differences on intentions to wear a face covering. We find that men less than women intend to wear a face covering, but this difference almost disappears in counties where wearing a face covering is mandatory. We also find that men less than women believe that they will be seriously affected by the coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics actually show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women). Finally, we also find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering. Men more than women agree that wearing a face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma; and these gender differences also mediate gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering."	766
Tracking COVID-19 by Tracking Infectious Trajectories	Badreddine Benreguia,Hamouma Moumen,Mohammed Amine Merzoug	2020/05/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05523v1	ArXiv	Nowadays, the coronavirus pandemic has and is still causing large numbers of deaths and infected people. Although governments all over the world have taken severe measurements to slow down the virus spreading (e.g., travel restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities, quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot more are still in danger. Indeed, a recently conducted study~\cite{ref2} has reported that 79\% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients. Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.	767
How sustainable environments have reduced the diffusion of coronavirus  disease 2019: the interaction between spread of COVID-19 infection, polluting  industrialization, wind (renewable) energy	Mario Coccia	2020/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08293v1	ArXiv	This study endeavors to explain the relation between air pollution and particulate compounds emissions, wind resources and energy, and the diffusion of COVID-19 infection to provide insights of sustainable policy to prevent future epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy, one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in society.	768
Magnetic Immunoassays: A Review of Virus and Pathogen Detection Before  and Amidst the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19)	Kai Wu,Renata Saha,Diqing Su,Venkatramana D. Krishna,Jinming Liu,Maxim C-J Cheeran,Jian-Ping Wang	2020/07/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04809v1	ArXiv	The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a threat to the global healthcare system and economic security. As of July 2020, no specific drugs or vaccines are yet available for COVID-19, fast and accurate diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 is essential in slowing down the spread of COVID-19 and for efficient implementation of control and containment strategies. Magnetic immunoassay is a novel and emerging topic representing the frontiers of current biosensing and magnetics areas. The past decade has seen rapid growth in applying magnetic tools for biological and biomedical applications. Recent advances in magnetic materials and nanotechnologies have transformed current diagnostic methods to nanoscale and pushed the detection limit to early stage disease diagnosis. Herein, this review covers the literatures of magnetic immunoassay platforms for virus and pathogen detections, before COVID-19. We reviewed the popular magnetic immunoassay platforms including magnetoresistance (MR) sensors, magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Magnetic Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic kits are also reviewed aiming at developing plug-and-play diagnostics to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as well as preventing future epidemics. In addition, other platforms that use magnetic materials as auxiliary tools for enhanced pathogen and virus detections are also covered. The goal of this review is to inform the researchers of diagnostic and surveillance platforms for SARS-CoV-2 and their performances.	769
Software Development During COVID-19 Pandemic: an Analysis of Stack  Overflow and GitHub	Pedro Almir Martins de Oliveira,Pedro de Alcântara dos Santos Neto,Gleison Silva,Irvayne Ibiapina,Werney Lira,Rossana Maria de Castro Andrade	2021/03/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05494v1	ArXiv	The new coronavirus became a severe health issue for the world. This situation has motivated studies of different areas to combat this pandemic. In software engineering, we point out data visualization projects to follow the disease evolution, machine learning to estimate the pandemic behavior, and computer vision processing radiologic images. Most of these projects are stored in version control systems, and there are discussions about them in Question & Answer websites. In this work, we conducted a Mining Software Repository on a large number of questions and projects aiming to find trends that could help researchers and practitioners to fight against the coronavirus. We analyzed 1,190 questions from Stack Overflow and Data Science Q\&A and 60,352 GitHub projects. We identified a correlation between the questions and projects throughout the pandemic. The main questions about coronavirus are how-to, related to web scraping and data visualization, using Python, JavaScript, and R. The most recurrent GitHub projects are machine learning projects, using JavaScript, Python, and Java.	770
Evolutionary trend of SARS-CoV-2 inferred by the homopolymeric  nucleotide repeats	Changchuan Yin	2022/01/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00238v1	ArXiv	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, in which millions of lives have been lost. Understanding the zoonotic evolution of the coronavirus may provide insights for developing effective vaccines, monitoring the transmission trends, and preventing new zoonotic infections. Homopolymeric nucleotide repeats (HP), the most simple tandem repeats, are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic genomes. Yet the HP distributions and roles in coronavirus genome evolution are poorly investigated. In this study, we characterize the HP distributions and trends in the genomes of bat and human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results show that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is abundant in HPs, and has augmented HP contents during evolution. Especially, the disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G) of coronaviruses increases during the evolution in human hosts. The disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G) is correlated to host adaptation and the virulence level of the coronaviruses. Therefore, we propose that the HP disparity can be a quantitative measure for the zoonotic evolution levels of coronaviruses. Peculiarly, the HP disparity measure infers that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants have a high disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G), suggesting a high adaption to the human hosts.	771
Decoding the double trouble: A mathematical modelling of co-infection  dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza-like illness	Suman Bhowmick,Igor M. Sokolov,Hartmut H. K. Lentz	2022/10/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05649v1	ArXiv	After the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December, the cases of Covid-19 have spiralled out around the globe. Due to the clinical similarity of Covid-19 with other flulike syndromes, patients are assayed for other pathogens of influenza like illness. There have been reported cases of co-infection amongst patients with Covid-19. Bacteria for example Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila etc and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus etc are identified as co-pathogens. In our current effort, we develop and analysed a compartmental based Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) type mathematical model to understand the co-infection dynamics of Covid-19 and other influenza type illness. In this work we have incorporated the saturated treatment rate to take account of the impact of limited treatment resources to control the possible Covid-19 cases. As results, we formulate the basic reproduction number of the model system. Finally, we have performed numerical simulations of the co-infection model to examine the solutions in different zones of parameter space.	772
Information Mining for COVID-19 Research From a Large Volume of  Scientific Literature	Sabber Ahamed,Manar Samad	2020/04/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02085v1	ArXiv	The year 2020 has seen an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic due to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus in 180 countries. In a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus. The categorical summary of these keywords and topics may be a useful reference to expedite and recommend new and alternative directions for COVID-19 research.	773
Information Seeking Responses to News of Local COVID-19 Cases: Evidence  from Internet Search Data	Ana I. Bento,Thuy Nguyen,Coady Wing,Felipe Lozano-Rojas,Yong-Yeol Ahn,Kosali Simon	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04591v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a global pandemic with community circulation in many countries, including the U.S. where every state is reporting confirmed cases. The course of this pandemic will be largely shaped by how governments enact timely policies, disseminate the information, and most importantly, how the public reacts to them. Here, we examine informationseeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. By using an eventstudy framework, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away, but the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements were followed by increasingly strong measures. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing), or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are encouraging given our study period is relatively early in the epidemic and more elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis will track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.	774
Coronavirus (COVID-19): ARIMA based time-series analysis to forecast  near future	Hiteshi Tandon,Prabhat Ranjan,Tanmoy Chakraborty,Vandana Suhag	2020/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07859v1	ArXiv	COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, is currently a major worldwide threat. It has infected more than a million people globally leading to hundred-thousands of deaths. In such grave circumstances, it is very important to predict the future infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the healthcare service preparation. Following that notion, we have developed a model and then employed it for forecasting future COVID-19 cases in India. The study indicates an ascending trend for the cases in the coming days. A time series analysis also presents an exponential increase in the number of cases. It is supposed that the present prediction models will assist the government and medical personnel to be prepared for the upcoming conditions and have more readiness in healthcare systems.	775
Flattening the Curve: Insights From Queueing Theory	Sergio Palomo,Jamol Pender,William Massey,Robert C. Hampshire	2020/04/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09645v1	ArXiv	The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the insights from the model.	776
ReCOVery: A Multimodal Repository for COVID-19 News Credibility Research	Xinyi Zhou,Apurva Mulay,Emilio Ferrara,Reza Zafarani	2020/06/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05557v2	ArXiv	"First identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared as a global emergency in January, and a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Along with this pandemic, we are also experiencing an ""infodemic"" of information with low credibility such as fake news and conspiracies. In this work, we present ReCOVery, a repository designed and constructed to facilitate research on combating such information regarding COVID-19. We first broadly search and investigate ~2,000 news publishers, from which 60 are identified with extreme [high or low] levels of credibility. By inheriting the credibility of the media on which they were published, a total of 2,029 news articles on coronavirus, published from January to May 2020, are collected in the repository, along with 140,820 tweets that reveal how these news articles have spread on the Twitter social network. The repository provides multimodal information of news articles on coronavirus, including textual, visual, temporal, and network information. The way that news credibility is obtained allows a trade-off between dataset scalability and label accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to present data statistics and distributions, as well as to provide baseline performances for predicting news credibility so that future methods can be compared. Our repository is available at http://coronavirus-fakenews.com."	777
Predicting inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using  machine learning and virtual screening	Romeo Cozac,Nazim Medzhidov,Shinya Yuki	2020/06/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06523v1	ArXiv	Global coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by newly identified SARS- CoV-2 coronavirus continues to claim the lives of thousands of people worldwide. The unavailability of specific medications to treat COVID-19 has led to drug repositioning efforts using various approaches, including computational analyses. Such analyses mostly rely on molecular docking and require the 3D structure of the target protein to be available. In this study, we utilized a set of machine learning algorithms and trained them on a dataset of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors to run inference analyses on antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs solely based on the ligand information. We also performed virtual screening analysis of the drug candidates predicted by machine learning models and docked them against the active site of SARS- CoV-2 RdRp, a key component of the virus replication machinery. Based on the ligand information of RdRp inhibitors, the machine learning models were able to identify candidates such as remdesivir and baloxavir marboxil, molecules with documented activity against RdRp of the novel coronavirus. Among the other identified drug candidates were beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp enzyme, and HCV protease inhibitors paritaprevir and faldaprevir. Further analysis of these candidates using molecular docking against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed low binding energies against the enzyme active site. Our approach also identified anti-inflammatory drugs lupeol, lifitegrast, antrafenine, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid to have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We propose that the results of this study are considered for further validation as potential therapeutic options against COVID-19.	778
Drug Repurposing to find Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease	Emilio Angelina,Sebastian Andujar,Oscar Parravicini,Daniel Enriz,Nelida Peruchena	2020/06/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14790v1	ArXiv	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and so, there is an urgent need for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to combat the disease until a vaccine will be available worldwide. Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (over conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that time frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few number of clinical trial required. In this work, a virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as potential inhibitors of the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12 drugs are proposed as candidates for inhibitors of the Mpro enzyme. Some of the selected compounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials (i.e. ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of the disease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the most promising candidate is the naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline. This compound has largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates along all filtering steps of our virtual screening protocol. If the activity of any of these drugs is experimentally corroborated, they could be used directly in clinical trials without the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they are already used as drugs for other diseases.	779
COVID-19 Pandemic Severity, Lockdown Regimes, and People Mobility: Early  Evidence from 88 Countries	Md. Mokhlesur Rahman,Jean-Claude Thill,Kamal Chandra Paul	2020/07/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08150v2	ArXiv	This study empirically investigates the complex interplay between the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, mobility changes in retail and recreation, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas, and lockdown measures in 88 countries of the word. To conduct the study, data on mobility patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e.g., Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer). A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic.	780
Hope Amid of a Pandemic: Is Psychological Distress Alleviating in South  America while Coronavirus is still on Surge?	Josimar Chire-Saire,Khalid Mahmood	2020/08/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12289v1	ArXiv	As of July 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has over 17 million reported cases, causing more than 667,000 deaths. Countries irrespective of economic status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including health, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent the outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics, for example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings, restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social interactions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown, psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in order to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which declined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the South American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the overall psychological distress.	781
IoT Platform for COVID-19 Prevention and Control: A Survey	Yudi Dong,Yu-Dong Yao	2020/10/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08056v2	ArXiv	As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics.	782
Tracing the origins of SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus phylogenies	Erwan Sallard,José Halloy,Didier Casane,Etienne Decroly,Jacques van Helden	2020/11/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12567v1	ArXiv	SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus (CoV), which emerged in China in late 2019 and is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic that caused more than 59 million infections and 1.4 million deaths in 11 months. Understanding the origin of this virus is an important issue and it is necessary to determine the mechanisms of its dissemination in order to contain future epidemics. Based on phylogenetic inferences, sequence analysis and structure-function relationships of coronavirus proteins, informed by the knowledge currently available on the virus, we discuss the different scenarios evoked to account for the origin - natural or synthetic - of the virus. The data currently available is not sufficient to firmly assert whether SARS-CoV2 results from a zoonotic emergence or from an accidental escape of a laboratory strain. This question needs to be solved because it has important consequences on the evaluation of risk/benefit balance of our interaction with ecosystems, the intensive breeding of wild and domestic animals, as well as some lab practices and on scientific policy and biosafety regulations. Regardless of its origin, studying the evolution of the molecular mechanisms involved in the emergence of pandemic viruses is essential to develop therapeutic and vaccine strategies and to prevent future zoonoses.

Google Searches and COVID-19 Cases in Saudi Arabia: A Correlation Study	Btool Hamoui,Abdulaziz Alashaikh,Eisa Alanazi	2020/11/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14386v1	ArXiv	Background: The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected human life to a great extent on a worldwide scale. During the coronavirus pandemic, public health professionals at the early outbreak faced an extraordinary challenge to track and quantify the spread of disease. Objective: To investigate whether a digital surveillance model using google trends (GT) is feasible to monitor the outbreak of coronavirus in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methods: We retrieve GT data using ten common COVID-19 symptoms related keywords from March 2, 2020, to October 31, 2020. Spearman correlation were performed to determine the correlation between COVID-19 cases and the Google search terms. Results: GT data related to Cough and Sore Throat were the most searched symptoms by the Internet users in Saudi Arabia. The highest daily correlation found with the Loss of Smell followed by Loss of Taste and Diarrhea. Strong correlation as well was found between the weekly confirmed cases and the same symptoms: Loss of Smell, Loss of Taste and Diarrhea. Conclusions: We conducted an investigation study utilizing Internet searches related to COVID-19 symptoms for surveillance of the pandemic spread. This study documents that google searches can be used as a supplementary surveillance tool in COVID-19 monitoring in Saudi Arabia.	784
Policy-Aware Mobility Model Explains the Growth of COVID-19 in Cities	Zhenyu Han,Fengli Xu,Yong Li,Tao Jiang,Depeng Jin,Jianhua Lu,James A. Evans	2021/02/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10538v1	ArXiv	"With the continued spread of coronavirus, the task of forecasting distinctive COVID-19 growth curves in different cities, which remain inadequately explained by standard epidemiological models, is critical for medical supply and treatment. Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban ""superspreading"", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can facilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively mitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies."	785
Efficient Masked Face Recognition Method during the COVID-19 Pandemic	Walid Hariri	2021/05/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03026v2	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an unparalleled crisis leading to a huge number of casualties and security problems. In order to reduce the spread of coronavirus, people often wear masks to protect themselves. This makes face recognition a very difficult task since certain parts of the face are hidden. A primary focus of researchers during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is to come up with suggestions to handle this problem through rapid and efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a reliable method based on occlusion removal and deep learning-based features in order to address the problem of the masked face recognition process. The first step is to remove the masked face region. Next, we apply three pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) namely, VGG-16, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, and use them to extract deep features from the obtained regions (mostly eyes and forehead regions). The Bag-of-features paradigm is then applied to the feature maps of the last convolutional layer in order to quantize them and to get a slight representation comparing to the fully connected layer of classical CNN. Finally, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is applied for the classification process. Experimental results on Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset show high recognition performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.	786
Sleeping beauties and temporal evolution of the coronavirus literature	Milad Haghani,Pegah Varamini	2021/06/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04810v2	ArXiv	Temporal evolution of the coronavirus literature over the last thirty years (N=43,769) is analyzed along with its subdomain of SARS-CoV-2 articles (N=27,460) and the subdomain of reviews and meta-analytic studies (N=1,027). (i) The analyses on the subset of SARS-CoV-2 literature identified studies published prior to 2020 that have now proven highly instrumental in the development of various clusters of publications linked to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the so-called sleeping beauties of the coronavirus literature with an awakening in 2020 were identified, i.e., previously published studies of this literature that had remained relatively unnoticed for several years but gained sudden traction in 2020 in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. (ii) The subset of 2020 SARS-CoV-2 articles is bibliographically distant from the rest of this literature published prior to 2020. Individual articles of the SARS-CoV-2 segment with a bridging role between the two bodies of articles (i.e., before and after 2020) are identifiable. (iii) Furthermore, the degree of bibliographic coupling within the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 cluster is much poorer compared to the cluster of articles published prior to 2020. This could, in part, be explained by the higher diversity of topics that are studied in relation to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the literature of coronaviruses published prior to the SARS-CoV-2 disease. This work demonstrates how scholarly efforts undertaken during peace time or prior to a disease outbreak could suddenly play a critical role in prevention and mitigation of health disasters caused by new diseases.	787
IRLCov19: A Large COVID-19 Multilingual Twitter Dataset of Indian  Regional Languages	Deepak Uniyal,Amit Agarwal	2021/07/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12360v1	ArXiv	Emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world despite authorities having made available a number of vaccines. While the coronavirus has been around for a significant period of time, people and authorities still feel the need for awareness due to the mutating nature of the virus and therefore varying symptoms and prevention strategies. People and authorities resort to social media platforms the most to share awareness information and voice out their opinions due to their massive outreach in spreading the word in practically no time. People use a number of languages to communicate over social media platforms based on their familiarity, language outreach, and availability on social media platforms. The entire world has been hit by the coronavirus and India is the second worst-hit country in terms of the number of active coronavirus cases. India, being a multilingual country, offers a great opportunity to study the outreach of various languages that have been actively used across social media platforms. In this study, we aim to study the dataset related to COVID-19 collected in the period between February 2020 to July 2020 specifically for regional languages in India. This could be helpful for the Government of India, various state governments, NGOs, researchers, and policymakers in studying different issues related to the pandemic. We found that English has been the mode of communication in over 64% of tweets while as many as twelve regional languages in India account for approximately 4.77% of tweets.	788
A k-mer Based Approach for SARS-CoV-2 Variant Identification	Sarwan Ali,Bikram Sahoo,Naimat Ullah,Alexander Zelikovskiy,Murray Patterson,Imdadullah Khan	2021/08/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03465v5	ArXiv	With the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe and its continuous mutation, it is of pivotal importance to design a system to identify different known (and unknown) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Identifying particular variants helps to understand and model their spread patterns, design effective mitigation strategies, and prevent future outbreaks. It also plays a crucial role in studying the efficacy of known vaccines against each variant and modeling the likelihood of breakthrough infections. It is well known that the spike protein contains most of the information/variation pertaining to coronavirus variants.   In this paper, we use spike sequences to classify different variants of the coronavirus in humans. We show that preserving the order of the amino acids helps the underlying classifiers to achieve better performance. We also show that we can train our model to outperform the baseline algorithms using only a small number of training samples ($1\%$ of the data). Finally, we show the importance of the different amino acids which play a key role in identifying variants and how they coincide with those reported by the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).	789
Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on Economy from the Perspective of  Users Reviews	Fatemeh Salmani,Hamed Vahdat-Nejad,Hamideh Hajiabadi	2021/10/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02198v1	ArXiv	One of the most important incidents in the world in 2020 is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. Users on social networks publish a large number of comments about this event. These comments contain important hidden information of public opinion regarding this pandemic. In this research, a large number of Coronavirus-related tweets are considered and analyzed using natural language processing and information retrieval science. Initially, the location of the tweets is determined using a dictionary prepared through the Geo-Names geographic database, which contains detailed and complete information of places such as city names, streets, and postal codes. Then, using a large dictionary prepared from the terms of economics, related tweets are extracted and sentiments corresponded to tweets are analyzed with the help of the RoBERTa language-based model, which has high accuracy and good performance. Finally, the frequency chart of tweets related to the economy and their sentiment scores (positive and negative tweets) is plotted over time for the entire world and the top 10 economies. From the analysis of the charts, we learn that the reason for publishing economic tweets is not only the increase in the number of people infected with the Coronavirus but also imposed restrictions and lockdowns in countries. The consequences of these restrictions include the loss of millions of jobs and the economic downturn.	790
Novel coronavirus pneumonia lesion segmentation in CT images	Yuanyuan Peng,Zixu Zhang,Hongbin Tu,Xiong Li	2021/10/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12827v3	ArXiv	Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spread widely in the world, causing a huge threat to people's living environment. Objective: Under computed tomography (CT) imaging, the structure features of COVID-19 lesions are complicated and varied greatly in different cases. To accurately locate COVID-19 lesions and assist doctors to make the best diagnosis and treatment plan, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT images. Methods: Considering the fact that a large number of COVID-19 CT images and the corresponding lesion annotations are difficult to obtained, a transfer learning strategy is employed to make up for the shortcoming and alleviate the overfitting problem. Based on the reality that traditional single deep learning framework is difficult to extract COVID-19 lesion features effectively, which may cause some lesions to be undetected. To overcome the problem, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented to combine with local and global features for COVID-19 lesion segmentation. Results: The performance of the proposed method was validated in experiments with a publicly available dataset. Compared with manual annotations, the proposed method acquired a high intersection over union (IoU) of 0.7279. Conclusion: A deep-supervised ensemble learning network was presented for coronavirus pneumonia lesion segmentation in CT images. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by visual inspection and quantitative evaluation. Experimental results shown that the proposed mehtod has a perfect performance in COVID-19 lesion segmentation.	791
Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling for COVID-19 Vaccine Discussions	Hui Yin,Xiangyu Song,Shuiqiao Yang,Jianxin Li	2021/10/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04415v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lasted for nearly two years and caused unprecedented impacts on people's daily life around the world. Even worse, the emergence of the COVID-19 Delta variant once again puts the world in danger. Fortunately, many countries and companies have started to develop coronavirus vaccines since the beginning of this disaster. Till now, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The promotion of COVID-19 vaccination around the world also brings a lot of discussions on social media about different aspects of vaccines, such as efficacy and security. However, there does not exist much research work to systematically analyze public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus vaccine on Twitter to understand the trending topics and their corresponding sentimental polarities regarding the country and vaccine levels. The results show that a majority of people are confident in the effectiveness of vaccines and are willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, the negative tweets are often associated with the complaints of vaccine shortages, side effects after injections and possible death after being vaccinated. Overall, this study exploits popular NLP and topic modeling methods to mine people's opinions on the COVID-19 vaccines on social media and to analyse and visualise them objectively. Our findings can improve the readability of the noisy information on social media and provide effective data support for the government and policy makers.	792
Topic Modelling of Swedish Newspaper Articles about Coronavirus: a Case  Study using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Method	Bernadeta Griciūtė,Lifeng Han,Goran Nenadic	2023/01/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03029v6	ArXiv	Topic Modelling (TM) is from the research branches of natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP) that is to facilitate insightful analysis from large documents and datasets, such as a summarisation of main topics and the topic changes. This kind of discovery is getting more popular in real-life applications due to its impact on big data analytics. In this study, from the social-media and healthcare domain, we apply popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods to model the topic changes in Swedish newspaper articles about Coronavirus. We describe the corpus we created including 6515 articles, methods applied, and statistics on topic changes over approximately 1 year and two months period of time from 17th January 2020 to 13th March 2021. We hope this work can be an asset for grounding applications of topic modelling and can be inspiring for similar case studies in an era with pandemics, to support socio-economic impact research as well as clinical and healthcare analytics.

Detection of a facemask in real-time using deep learning methods:  Prevention of Covid 19	Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Jatin Sohlot,Ayesha Siddiqui,Ramsha Siddiqui,Karan Malik,Samar Wazir,Alexander E. I. Brownlee	2024/01/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15675v1	ArXiv	A health crisis is raging all over the world with the rapid transmission of the novel-coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Out of the guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to protect us against Covid-19, wearing a facemask is the most effective. Many countries have necessitated the wearing of face masks, but monitoring a large number of people to ensure that they are wearing masks in a crowded place is a challenging task in itself. The novel-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has already affected our day-to-day life as well as world trade movements. By the end of April 2021, the world has recorded 144,358,956 confirmed cases of novel-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) including 3,066,113 deaths according to the world health organization (WHO). These increasing numbers motivate automated techniques for the detection of a facemask in real-time scenarios for the prevention of Covid-19. We propose a technique using deep learning that works for single and multiple people in a frame recorded via webcam in still or in motion. We have also experimented with our approach in night light. The accuracy of our model is good compared to the other approaches in the literature; ranging from 74% for multiple people in a nightlight to 99% for a single person in daylight.	794
The Pace and Pulse of the Fight against Coronavirus across the US, A  Google Trends Approach	Tichakunda Mangono,Peter Smittenaar,Yael Caplan,Vincent S. Huang,Staci Sutermaster,Hannah Kemp,Sema K. Sgaier	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02489v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus pandemic is impacting our lives at unprecedented speed and scale - including how we eat and work, what we worry about, how much we move, and our ability to earn. Google Trends can be used as a proxy for what people are thinking, needing, and planning. We use it to provide both insights into, and potential indicators of, important changes in information-seeking patterns during pandemics like COVID-19. Key questions we address are: (1) What is the relationship between the coronavirus outbreak and internet searches related to healthcare seeking, government support programs, media sources of different ideologies, planning around social activities, travel, and food, and new coronavirus-specific behaviors and concerns?; (2) How does the popularity of search terms differ across states and regions and can we explain these differences?; (3) Can we find distinct, tangible search patterns across states suggestive of policy gaps to inform pandemic response? (4) Does Google Trends data correlate with and potentially precede real-life events? We suggest strategic shifts for policy makers to improve the precision and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and recommend the development of a real-time dashboard as a decision-making tool. Methods used include trend analysis of US search data; geographic analyses of the differences in search popularity across US states during March 1st to April 15th, 2020; and Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to extract search patterns across states.	795

Beyond the Virus: A First Look at Coronavirus-themed Mobile Malware	Liu Wang,Ren He,Haoyu Wang,Pengcheng Xia,Yuanchun Li,Lei Wu,Yajin Zhou,Xiapu Luo,Yulei Sui,Yao Guo,Guoai Xu	2020/05/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14619v3	ArXiv	As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, a number of malicious actors have started capitalizing the topic. Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a long time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious developers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community. Till now, over 30 research institutes around the world have requested our dataset for COVID-19 themed research.	797

Detecting fake news for the new coronavirus by reasoning on the Covid-19  ontology	Adrian Groza	2020/04/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12330v1	ArXiv	"In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, many were quick to spread deceptive information. I investigate here how reasoning in Description Logics (DLs) can detect inconsistencies between trusted medical sources and not trusted ones. The not-trusted information comes in natural language (e.g. ""Covid-19 affects only the elderly""). To automatically convert into DLs, I used the FRED converter. Reasoning in Description Logics is then performed with the Racer tool."	800
A hydrophobic-interaction-based mechanism trigger docking between the  SARS CoV 2 spike and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2	Jiacheng Li,Xiaoliang Ma,Shuai Guo,Chengyu Hou,Liping Shi,Hongchi Zhang,Bing Zheng,Chencheng Liao,Lin Yang,Lin Ye,Xiaodong He	2020/08/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11883v1	ArXiv	"A recent experimental study found that the binding affinity between the cellular receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike (S) protein of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is more than 10-fold higher than that of the original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, main-chain structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are almost the same with that of the SARS-CoV RBD. Understanding physical mechanism responsible for the outstanding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 is the ""urgent challenge"" for developing blockers, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Considering the mechanisms of hydrophobic interaction, hydration shell, surface tension, and the shielding effect of water molecules, this study reveals a hydrophobic-interaction-based mechanism by means of which SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 bind together in an aqueous environment. The hydrophobic interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 protein is found to be significantly greater than that between SARS-CoV S and ACE2. At the docking site, the hydrophobic portions of the hydrophilic side chains of SARS-CoV-2 S are found to be involved in the hydrophobic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. We propose a method to design live attenuated viruses by mutating several key amino acid residues of the spike protein to decrease the hydrophobic surface areas at the docking site. Mutation of a small amount of residues can greatly reduce the hydrophobic binding of the coronavirus to the receptor, which may be significant reduce infectivity and transmissibility of the virus."	801

Sotolongo-Costa	2021/02/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13208v1	ArXiv	Using nonlinear mathematical models and experimental data from laboratory and clinical studies, we have designed new combination therapies against COVID-19.	802
Efficient Approximate Kernel Based Spike Sequence Classification	Sarwan Ali,Bikram Sahoo,Muhammad Asad Khan,Alexander Zelikovsky,Imdad Ullah Khan,Murray Patterson	2022/09/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04952v1	ArXiv	"Machine learning (ML) models, such as SVM, for tasks like classification and clustering of sequences, require a definition of distance/similarity between pairs of sequences. Several methods have been proposed to compute the similarity between sequences, such as the exact approach that counts the number of matches between $k$-mers (sub-sequences of length $k$) and an approximate approach that estimates pairwise similarity scores. Although exact methods yield better classification performance, they pose high computational costs, limiting their applicability to a small number of sequences. The approximate algorithms are proven to be more scalable and perform comparably to (sometimes better than) the exact methods -- they are designed in a ""general"" way to deal with different types of sequences (e.g., music, protein, etc.). Although general applicability is a desired property of an algorithm, it is not the case in all scenarios. For example, in the current COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, there is a need for an approach that can deal specifically with the coronavirus. To this end, we propose a series of ways to improve the performance of the approximate kernel (using minimizers and information gain) in order to enhance its predictive performance pm coronavirus sequences. More specifically, we improve the quality of the approximate kernel using domain knowledge (computed using information gain) and efficient preprocessing (using minimizers computation) to classify coronavirus spike protein sequences corresponding to different variants (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Gamma). We report results using different classification and clustering algorithms and evaluate their performance using multiple evaluation metrics. Using two datasets, we show that our proposed method helps improve the kernel's performance compared to the baseline and state-of-the-art approaches in the healthcare domain."	803
Medium. Permeation: SARS-COV-2 Painting Creation by Generative Model	Yuan-Fu Yang,Iuan-Kai Fang,Min Sun,Su-Chu Hsu	2023/04/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11354v1	ArXiv	"Airborne particles are the medium for SARS-CoV-2 to invade the human body. Light also reflects through suspended particles in the air, allowing people to see a colorful world. Impressionism is the most prominent art school that explores the spectrum of color created through color reflection of light. We find similarities of color structure and color stacking in the Impressionist paintings and the illustrations of the novel coronavirus by artists around the world. With computerized data analysis through the main tones, the way of color layout, and the way of color stacking in the paintings of the Impressionists, we train computers to draw the novel coronavirus in an Impressionist style using a Generative Adversarial Network to create our artwork ""Medium. Permeation"". This artwork is composed of 196 randomly generated viral pictures arranged in a 14 by 14 matrix to form a large-scale painting. In addition, we have developed an extended work: Gradual Change, which is presented as video art. We use Graph Neural Network to present 196 paintings of the new coronavirus to the audience one by one in a gradual manner. In front of LED TV screen, audience will find 196 virus paintings whose colors will change continuously. This large video painting symbolizes that worldwide 196 countries have been invaded by the epidemic, and every nation continuously pops up mutant viruses. The speed of vaccine development cannot keep up with the speed of virus mutation. This is also the first generative art in the world based on the common features and a metaphorical symbiosis between Impressionist art and the novel coronavirus. This work warns us of the unprecedented challenges posed by the SARS-CoV-2, implying that the world should not ignore the invisible enemy who uses air as a medium."	804
Data analysis on Coronavirus spreading by macroscopic growth laws	P. Castorina,A. Iorio,D. Lanteri	2020/03/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00507v3	ArXiv	To evaluate the effectiveness of the containment on the epidemic spreading of the new Coronavirus disease 2019, we carry on an analysis of the time evolution of the infection in a selected number of different Countries, by considering well-known macroscopic growth laws, the Gompertz law, and the logistic law. We also propose here a generalization of Gompertz law. Our data analysis permits an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data must be compared with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under control. From our analysis it appears that the spreading reached saturation in China, due to the strong containment policy of the national government. In Singapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new strong spreading. For South Korea and Italy, instead, the next data on new infections will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher numbers of infected individuals.	805
Phylogenetic Study of 2019-nCoV by Using Alignment Free Method  (Evolutionary Bifurcation of Novel Coronavirus Mutants)	Yang Gao,Tao Li,Liaofu Luo	2020/03/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01324v3	ArXiv	The phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 (nCov-19) viruses is reconstructed according to the similarity of genome sequences. The tree topology of Betacoronavirus is remarkably consistent with biologist's systematics. Because the tree construction contains enough information about virus mutants, it is suitable to study the evolutionary relationship between novel coronavirus mutants transmitted among humans. The emergences of 14 kinds of main mutants are studied and these strains can be classified as eight bifurcations of the phylogenetic tree. It is found that there exist three types of virus mutations, namely, the mutation among sub-branches of the same branch, the off-root mutation and the root-oriented mutation between large branches of the tree. From the point of the relation between viral mutation and host selection we found that individuals with low immunity provide a special environment for the positive natural selection of virus evolution. It gives a mechanism to explain why large mutations between two distant branches generally occur in the nCov-19 phylogenetic tree. The finding is helpful to formulate strategies to control the spread of COVID-19.	806
From plague to coronavirus: On the value of ship traffic data for  epidemic modeling	Katherine Hoffmann Pham,Miguel Luengo-Oroz	2020/03/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02253v1	ArXiv	In addition to moving people and goods, ships can spread disease. Ship traffic may complement air traffic as a source of import risk, and cruise ships - with large passenger volumes and multiple stops - are potential hotspots, in particular for diseases with long incubation periods. Vessel trajectory data from ship Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) is available online and it is possible to extract and analyze this data. We illustrate this in the case of the current coronavirus epidemic, in which hundreds of infected individuals have traveled in ships captured in the AIS dataset. This real time and historical data should be included in epidemiological models of disease to inform the corresponding operational response.	807
Flight restrictions from China during the COVID-2019 Coronavirus  outbreak	Stefano Maria Iacus,Fabrizio Natale,Michele Vespe	2020/03/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03686v1	ArXiv	This short note provides estimates of the number of passengers that travel from China to all world airports in the period October 2019 - March 2020 on the basis of historical data. From this baseline we subtract the expected reduction in the number of passengers taking into account the temporary ban of some routes which was put in place since 23 January 2020 following the COVID-2019 Coronavirus outbreak. The results indicate a reduction of the number of passengers in the period January - March 2020 of -2.5%. This calculation considers only the complete closure of routes (not just direct flights) and not the reduction in the number of passengers on still active direct and indirect connections. At the moment of writing, with such partial information it is premature to quantify economic losses on the civil air transport and tourism industry. This note is meant to provide a baseline that be extended to all countries of origin and updated as more recent data will become available.	808
In Silico Investigations on the Potential Inhibitors for COVID-19  Protease	Ambrish Kumar Srivastava,Abhishek Kumar,Gargi Tiwari,Ratnesh Kumar,Neeraj Misra	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10642v2	ArXiv	A novel strain of coronavirus, namely, COVID-19 has been identified in Wuhan city of China in December 2019. There are no specific therapies available and investigations regarding the treatment of the COVID-19 are still lacking. This prompted us to perform a preliminary in silico study on the COVID-19 protease with anti-malarial compounds in the search of potential inhibitor. We have calculated log P and log S values in addition to molecular docking and PASS predictions. Among the seven studied compounds, mepacrine appears as the potential inhibitor of the COVID-19 followed by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and phomarin. Therefore, these anti-malarial drugs may be potential drug candidate for the treatment of this novel coronavirus. A detailed analysis on these inhibitors is currently in progress and clinical studies are invited to investigate their potential medicinal use for the COVID-19.	809
Estimating Uncertainty and Interpretability in Deep Learning for  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Detection	Biraja Ghoshal,Allan Tucker	2020/03/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10769v2	ArXiv	Deep Learning has achieved state of the art performance in medical imaging. However, these methods for disease detection focus exclusively on improving the accuracy of classification or predictions without quantifying uncertainty in a decision. Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical diagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians trust in the technology and therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment. However, diagnostic uncertainty in the report is a challenging and yet inevitable task for radiologist. In this paper, we investigate how drop-weights based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in Deep Learning solution to improve the diagnostic performance of the human-machine team using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and show that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlates with accuracy of prediction. We believe that the availability of uncertainty-aware deep learning solution will enable a wider adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a clinical setting.	810
What is the people posting about symptoms related to Coronavirus in  Bogota, Colombia?	Josimar E. Chire Saire,Roberto C. Navarro	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11159v1	ArXiv	During the last months, there is an increasing alarm about a new mutation of coronavirus, covid-19 coined by World Health Organization(WHO) with an impact in many areas: economy, health, politics and others. This situation was declared a pandemic by WHO, because of the fast expansion over many countries. At the same time, people is using Social Networks to express what they think, feel or experiment, so this people are Social Sensors and helps to analyze what is happening in their city. The objective of this paper is analyze the publications of Colombian people living in Bogota with a radius of 50 km using Text Mining techniques from symptomatology approach. The results support the understanding of the spread in Colombia related to symptoms of covid19.	811
Mathematical Modeling of Epidemic Diseases; A Case Study of the COVID-19  Coronavirus	Reza Sameni	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11371v4	ArXiv	In this research, we study the propagation patterns of epidemic diseases such as the COVID-19 coronavirus, from a mathematical modeling perspective. The study is based on an extensions of the well-known susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) family of compartmental models. It is shown how social measures such as distancing, regional lockdowns, quarantine and global public health vigilance, influence the model parameters, which can eventually change the mortality rates and active contaminated cases over time, in the real world. As with all mathematical models, the predictive ability of the model is limited by the accuracy of the available data and to the so-called \textit{level of abstraction} used for modeling the problem. In order to provide the broader audience of researchers a better understanding of spreading patterns of epidemic diseases, a short introduction on biological systems modeling is also presented and the Matlab source codes for the simulations are provided online.	812
Epidemiological study of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)	Jagadish Kumar,K. P. S. S. Hembram	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11376v1	ArXiv	We report a statistical analysis of some highly infected countries by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The cumulative infected data were fitted with various growth models (e.g. Logistic equation, Weibull equation and Hill equation) and obtained the power index of top ten highly infected countries. The newly infected data were fitted with Gaussian distribution with the peak at ~40 days for the countries whose infection curves are seem to be saturated. The similarity in growth kinetics of infected people of different countries provides first-hand guidelines to take proper precautions to minimize human damage.	813
Electrical probing of COVID-19 spike protein receptor binding domain via  a graphene field-effect transistor	Xiaoyan Zhang,Qige Qi,Qiushi Jing,Shen Ao,Zhihong Zhang,Mingchao Ding,Muhong Wu,Kaihui Liu,Weipeng Wang,Yunhan Ling,Zhengjun Zhang,Wangyang Fu	2020/03/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12529v1	ArXiv	Here, in an effort towards facile and fast screening/diagnosis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we combined the unprecedently sensitive graphene field-effect transistor (Gr-FET) with highly selective antibody-antigen interaction to develop a coronavirus immunosensor. The Gr-FET immunosensors can rapidly identify (about 2 mins) and accurately capture the COVID-19 spike protein S1 (which contains a receptor binding domain, RBD) at a limit of detection down to 0.2 pM, in a real-time and label-free manner. Further results ensure that the Gr-FET immunosensors can be promisingly applied to screen for high-affinity antibodies (with binding constant up to 2*10^11 M^-1 against the RBD) at concentrations down to 0.1 pM. Thus, our developed electrical Gr-FET immunosensors provide an appealing alternative to address the early screening/diagnosis as well as the analysis and rational design of neutralizing-antibody locking methods of this ongoing public health crisis.	814
A physicist view of COVID-19 airborne infection through convective  airflow in indoor spaces	Luis A. Anchordoqui,Eugene M. Chudnovsky	2020/03/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13689v2	ArXiv	[Abridged] Naturally produced droplets from humans (such as those produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing) include several types of cells (e.g., epithelial cells and cells of the immune system), physiological electrolytes contained in mucous and saliva (e.g. Na+, K+, Cl-), as well as, potentially, several infectious agents (e.g. bacteria, fungi, and viruses). In response to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, which has become a major public health issue worldwide, we provide a concise overview of airborne germ transmission as seen from a physics perspective. We study whether coronavirus aerosols can travel far from the immediate neighborhood and get airborne with the convective currents developed within confined spaces. We also provide a recommendation that could help to slow down the spread of the virus.	815
Coronavirus and sports leagues: obtaining a fair ranking when the season  cannot resume	László Csató	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02280v4	ArXiv	Many sports leagues are played in a tightly scheduled round-robin format, leaving a limited time window to postpone matches. If the season cannot resume due to an external shock such as the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the ranking of the teams becomes non-trivial: it is necessary to account for schedule imbalances and possibly for the different number of matches played. First in the literature, we identify a set of desired axioms for ranking in these incomplete tournaments. It is verified that the generalised row sum, a parametric family of scoring rules, satisfies all of them. In particular, the well-established least squares method maximizes the influence of the strength of opponents on the ranking. Our approach is applied for six major premier European soccer competitions, where the rankings are found to be robust concerning the weight of adjustment for the strength of the opponents. Some methodologically simpler alternative policies are also discussed.	816
Networks in a World Unknown: Public WhatsApp Groups in the Venezuelan  Refugee Crisis	Adam Chang	2020/05/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05883v1	ArXiv	By early March 2020, five million Venezuelans had fled their home country after its complete economic and institutional collapse, and over 1.6 million have migrated to Colombia. Migrants struggle to start their lives over in Colombia, having arrived with few economic resources, and often no legal documentation, in cities with little to offer them. Venezuelan migrants, however, rely heavily on mobile phones and social media networks as lifelines for information, opportunities, and resources -- making WhatsApp both a critical tool for migrants' settlement and integration, as well as an invaluable source of data through which we can better understand migrant experiences. This thesis explores the dynamics of public WhatsApp groups used by Venezuelan migrants to Colombia, and what they can tell us about how migrants use and share information. We center our research on information spread and trust, especially as they intersect with concentration and geographic heterogeneity within groups. We analyze messages and memberships broadly, then explore interaction within groups, fake news and economic scams, and effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Our results have a range of policy implications, from reflections on Colombia's decision to shut its borders amidst the coronavirus pandemic, to understandings of how aid organizations can effectively share information over social media channels.	817
Public discourse and sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic: using  Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling on Twitter	Jia Xue,Junxiang Chen,Chen Chen,Chengda Zheng,Sijia Li,Tingshao Zhu	2020/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08817v3	ArXiv	"The study aims to understand Twitter users' discourse and psychological reactions to COVID-19. We use machine learning techniques to analyze about 1.9 million Tweets (written in English) related to coronavirus collected from January 23 to March 7, 2020. A total of salient 11 topics are identified and then categorized into ten themes, including ""updates about confirmed cases,"" ""COVID-19 related death,"" ""cases outside China (worldwide),"" ""COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea,"" ""early signs of the outbreak in New York,"" ""Diamond Princess cruise,"" ""economic impact,"" ""Preventive measures,"" ""authorities,"" and ""supply chain."" Results do not reveal treatments and symptoms related messages as prevalent topics on Twitter. Sentiment analysis shows that fear for the unknown nature of the coronavirus is dominant in all topics. Implications and limitations of the study are also discussed."	818
Repositioning of 8565 existing drugs for COVID-19	Kaifu Gao,Duc Duy Nguyen,Jiahui Chen,Rui Wang,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/05/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10028v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected near 5 million people and led to over 0.3 million deaths. Currently, there is no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 medication. New drug discovery typically takes more than ten years. Drug repositioning becomes one of the most feasible approaches for combating COVID-19. This work curates the largest available experimental dataset for SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV main protease inhibitors. Based on this dataset, we develop validated machine learning models with relatively low root mean square error to screen 1553 FDA-approved drugs as well as other 7012 investigational or off-market drugs in DrugBank. We found that many existing drugs might be potentially potent to SARS-CoV-2. The druggability of many potent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors is analyzed. This work offers a foundation for further experimental studies of COVID-19 drug repositioning.	819
Particle modeling of the spreading of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)	Hilla De-Leon,Francesco Pederiva	2020/05/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10357v2	ArXiv	By the end of July 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected more than seventeen million people and had spread to almost all countries worldwide. In response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social distancing, including local and national lockdowns. We use a Monte-Carlo (MC) based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population densities using the most recent epidemic data in our work. We test the spread of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each model and constraint. In this paper, we have tested three different time-cyclic patterns of no-restrictions/lockdown patterns. This model's main prediction is that a cyclic schedule of no-restrictions/lockdown that contains at least ten days of lockdown for each time cycle can help control the virus infection. In particular, this model reduces the infection rate when accompanied by social distancing and complete isolation of symptomatic patients.	820
Tracking, exploring and analyzing recent developments in German-language  online press in the face of the coronavirus crisis: cOWIDplus Analysis and  cOWIDplus Viewer	Sascha Wolfer,Alexander Koplenig,Frank Michaelis,Carolin Müller-Spitzer	2020/05/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13316v2	ArXiv	The coronavirus pandemic may be the largest crisis the world has had to face since World War II. It does not come as a surprise that it is also having an impact on language as our primary communication tool. We present three inter-connected resources that are designed to capture and illustrate these effects on a subset of the German language: An RSS corpus of German-language newsfeeds (with freely available untruncated unigram frequency lists), a static but continuously updated HTML page tracking the diversity of the used vocabulary and a web application that enables other researchers and the broader public to explore these effects without any or with little knowledge of corpus representation/exploration or statistical analyses.	821
Clinical trials impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: Adaptive designs to  the rescue?	Cornelia Ursula Kunz,Silke Jörgens,Frank Bretz,Nigel Stallard,Kelly Van Lancker,Dong Xi,Sarah Zohar,Christoph Gerlinger,Tim Friede	2020/05/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13979v1	ArXiv	Very recently the new pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has a number of consequences for the ongoing clinical trials in non-COVID-19 conditions. Motivated by four currently ongoing clinical trials in a variety of disease areas we illustrate the challenges faced by the pandemic and sketch out possible solutions including adaptive designs. Guidance is provided on (i) where blinded adaptations can help; (ii) how to achieve type I error rate control, if required; (iii) how to deal with potential treatment effect heterogeneity; (iv) how to utilize early readouts; and (v) how to utilize Bayesian techniques. In more detail approaches to resizing a trial affected by the pandemic are developed including considerations to stop a trial early, the use of group-sequential designs or sample size adjustment. All methods considered are implemented in a freely available R shiny app. Furthermore, regulatory and operational issues including the role of data monitoring committees are discussed.	822
On the Minimization of Sobolev Norms of Time-Varying Graph Signals:  Estimation of New Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cases	Jhony H. Giraldo,Thierry Bouwmans	2020/07/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00336v1	ArXiv	The mathematical modeling of infectious diseases is a fundamental research field for the planning of strategies to contain outbreaks. The models associated with this field of study usually have exponential prior assumptions in the number of new cases, while the exploration of spatial data has been little analyzed in these models. In this paper, we model the number of new cases of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a problem of reconstruction of time-varying graph signals. To this end, we proposed a new method based on the minimization of the Sobolev norm in graph signal processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in two COVID-19 databases provided by Johns Hopkins University. In the same way, we prove the benefits of the convergence rate of the Sobolev reconstruction method by relying on the condition number of the Hessian associated with the underlying optimization problem of our method.	823
Optimal COVID-19 infection spread under low temperature, dry air, and  low UV radiation	Eitan Asher,Yosef Ashkenazy,Shlomo Havlin,Alon Sela	2020/07/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09607v2	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is currently spreading rapidly throughout the world, causing many deaths and severe economic damage. It is believed that hot and humid conditions do not favor the novel coronavirus, yet this is still under debate due to many uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 data. Here we propose surrogate data tests to examine the preference of this virus to spread under different climate conditions. We find that the disease is significantly (above the 95% confidence level) more common when the temperature is $\sim$10$^\circ$C, the specific humidity is $\sim$5 g/kg, and the ultraviolet (UV) radiation is $\sim$80 kJ/m$^2$. The significance of relative humidity is below the 95% confidence level and does not show a preferred value. The results are supported using global and regional data, spanning the time period from January to July 2020. The COVID-19 data includes the daily reported new cases and daily death cases; for both, the population size is either taken into account or ignored.	824
Social capital may mediate the relationship between social distance and  COVID-19 prevalence	Keisuke Kokubun	2020/07/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09939v2	ArXiv	The threat of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is increasing. Regarding the difference in the infection rate observed in each region, in addition to studies seeking the cause due to differences in the social distance (population density), there is an increasing trend toward studies seeking the cause due to differences in social capital. However, studies have not yet been conducted on whether social capital could influence the infection rate even if it controls the effect of population density. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data for each prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only correlates with infection rates and population densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.	825
Coronavirus Knowledge Graph: A Case Study	Chongyan Chen,Islam Akef Ebeid,Yi Bu,Ying Ding	2020/07/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10287v1	ArXiv	The emergence of the novel COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global healthcare and the economy over the past few months. The virus's rapid widespread has led to a proliferation in biomedical research addressing the pandemic and its related topics. One of the essential Knowledge Discovery tools that could help the biomedical research community understand and eventually find a cure for COVID-19 are Knowledge Graphs. The CORD-19 dataset is a collection of publicly available full-text research articles that have been recently published on COVID-19 and coronavirus topics. Here, we use several Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Knowledge Graph construction and mining techniques to formalize and extract insights from the PubMed dataset and the CORD-19 dataset to identify COVID-19 related experts and bio-entities. Besides, we suggest possible techniques to predict related diseases, drug candidates, gene, gene mutations, and related compounds as part of a systematic effort to apply Knowledge Discovery methods to help biomedical researchers tackle the pandemic.	826
Mining of high throughput screening database reveals AP-1 and autophagy  pathways as potential targets for COVID-19 therapeutics	Hu Zhu,Catherine Z. Chen,Srilatha Sakamuru,Anton Simeonov,Mathew D. Hall,Menghang Xia,Wei Zheng,Ruili Huang	2020/07/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12242v1	ArXiv	The recent global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents an urgent need for new therapeutic candidates. Many efforts have been devoted to screening existing drug libraries with the hope to repurpose approved drugs as potential treatments for COVID-19. However, the antiviral mechanisms of action for the drugs found active in these phenotypic screens are largely unknown. To deconvolute the viral targets for more effective anti-COVID-19 drug development, we mined our in-house database of approved drug screens against 994 assays and compared their activity profiles with the drug activity profile in a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay of SARS-CoV-2. We found that the autophagy and AP-1 signaling pathway activity profiles are significantly correlated with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity profile. In addition, a class of neurology/psychiatry drugs was found significantly enriched with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Taken together, these results have provided new insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.	827
Maximal Interaction of Electromagnetic Radiation with Corona-Virions	Constantinos Valagiannopoulos,Ari Sihvola	2020/07/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13598v1	ArXiv	Absorption and scattering of the impinging electromagnetic waves are the two fundamental operations describing the energy exchange of any, organic or inorganic, particle with its environment. In the case of virion cells, substantial extinction power, counting both absorbing and scattering effects, is a prerequisite for performing a variety of coupling actions against the viral particles and, thus, a highly sought-after feature. By considering realistic dispersion for the dielectric permittivity of proteins and a core-shell modeling allowing for rigorous formulation via Mie theory, we report optical extinction resonances for corona-virions at mid-infrared range that are not significantly perturbed by changes in the objects size or the background host. Our findings indicate the optimal regime for interaction of photonic radiation with viral particles and may assist towards the development of equipment for thermal damage, disintegration or neutralization of coronavirus cells.	828
Computational evidence on repurposing the anti-influenza drugs baloxavir  acid and baloxavir marboxil against COVID-19	Suban K Sahoo,Seshu Vardhan	2020/09/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01094v1	ArXiv	The main reasons for the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic are the unavailability of recommended efficacious drugs or vaccines along with the human to human transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus. So, there is urgent need to search appropriate therapeutic approach by repurposing approved drugs. In this communication, molecular docking analyses of two influenza antiviral drugs baloxavir acid (BXA) and baloxavir marboxil (BXM) were performed with the three therapeutic target proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease (PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The molecular docking results of both the drugs BXA and BXM were analysed and compared. The investigational drug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro and RdRp, whereas the approved drug BXM binds only at the active site of RdRp. Also, comparison of dock score revealed that BXA is binding more effectively at the active site of RdRp than BXM. The computational molecular docking revealed that the drug BXA may be more effective against COVID-19 as compared to BXM.	829
Data Requests and Scenarios for Data Design of Unobserved Events in  Corona-related Confusion Using TEEDA	Teruaki Hayashi,Nao Uehara,Daisuke Hase,Yukio Ohsawa	2020/09/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04035v1	ArXiv	Due to the global violence of the novel coronavirus, various industries have been affected and the breakdown between systems has been apparent. To understand and overcome the phenomenon related to this unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19), the importance of data exchange and sharing across fields has gained social attention. In this study, we use the interactive platform called treasuring every encounter of data affairs (TEEDA) to externalize data requests from data users, which is a tool to exchange not only the information on data that can be provided but also the call for data, what data users want and for what purpose. Further, we analyze the characteristics of missing data in the corona-related confusion stemming from both the data requests and the providable data obtained in the workshop. We also create three scenarios for the data design of unobserved events focusing on variables.	830
Face Mask Detection using Transfer Learning of InceptionV3	G. Jignesh Chowdary,Narinder Singh Punn,Sanjay Kumar Sonbhadra,Sonali Agarwal	2020/09/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08369v2	ArXiv	The world is facing a huge health crisis due to the rapid transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). Several guidelines were issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) for protection against the spread of coronavirus. According to WHO, the most effective preventive measure against COVID-19 is wearing a mask in public places and crowded areas. It is very difficult to monitor people manually in these areas. In this paper, a transfer learning model is proposed to automate the process of identifying the people who are not wearing mask. The proposed model is built by fine-tuning the pre-trained state-of-the-art deep learning model, InceptionV3. The proposed model is trained and tested on the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD). Image augmentation technique is adopted to address the limited availability of data for better training and testing of the model. The model outperformed the other recently proposed approaches by achieving an accuracy of 99.9% during training and 100% during testing.	831
Design and study of a coronavirus-shaped metamaterial sensor stimulated  by electromagnetic waves for rapid diagnosis of covid-19	Yadgar I. Abdulkarim,Halgurd N. Awl,Fahmi F. Muhammadsharif,Karzan R. Sidiq,Salah Raza Saeed,Muharrem Karaaslan,Shengxiang Huang,Heng Luo,Lianwen Deng	2020/09/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08862v1	ArXiv	We propose a new technique of utilizing metamaterials-based sensor for rapid diagnosis of covid-19 through electromagnetic-stimulated analysis of the blood drawn from the patient. The sensor was inspired by a coronavirus in plane-shaped design with presume that its circular structure might produce a broader interaction of the electromagnetic waves with the blood sample. The sensor was designed numerically and tested experimentally by evaluating variations in the reflection coefficient (S11) and transmission coefficient (S21) of the waves at resonant frequency. Results of covid-19 relevant blood sample showed a pronounced shift in the main resonant frequency of about 740 MHz compared to that of the control blood sample. We believe that with the help of the proposed sensor a significant breakthrough can be achieved for rapid diagnosis of covid-19 within few seconds.	832
A time-modulated Hawkes process to model the spread of COVID-19 and the  impact of countermeasures	Michele Garetto,Emilio Leonardi,Giovanni Luca Torrisi	2021/01/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00405v1	ArXiv	Motivated by the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), we propose a stochastic model of epidemic temporal growth and mitigation based on a time-modulated Hawkes process. The model is sufficiently rich to incorporate specific characteristics of the novel coronavirus, to capture the impact of undetected, asymptomatic and super-diffusive individuals, and especially to take into account time-varying counter-measures and detection efforts. Yet, it is simple enough to allow scalable and efficient computation of the temporal evolution of the epidemic, and exploration of what-if scenarios. Compared to traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g., mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding light into several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing performed by the national health service.	833
Estimación de la trayectoria de coronavirus covid-19 adheridas a  gotitas respiratorias proyectados horizontalmente, considerando la altitud  geográfica	Julio Warthon,Amanda Olarte,Bruce Warthon	2021/01/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01359v1	ArXiv	This study deals with the estimation of the trajectory of coronavirus COVID-19 adhering to respiratory droplets projected horizontally, considering the geographical altitude. The size of viruses and respiratory droplets is the factor that determines the trajectory of the microparticles in a viscous medium such as air; For this purpose, a graphical comparison of the diameters and masses of the microparticles produced in respiratory activity has been made. The estimation of the vertical movement of the microparticles through the air is based on Stokes' Law, it was determined that respiratory droplets smaller than 10 {\mu}m in diameter have very small speeds, in practice they are floating for a few seconds before evaporating in the air; Regarding the horizontal displacement of respiratory droplets, frames from Scharfman et al. to determine its scope. In the case of a sneeze, the respiratory droplets can reach a distance of 1.65 m in 1 s, stopping rapidly until reaching 1.71 m in 2 seconds, then an analysis of the effect of geographical altitude on the movement of the micro-droplets was made, determining minimal change in kinematic variables.	834
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus and coronavirus in Google Dataset Search:  their scope and epidemiological correlation	Manuel Blázquez-Ochando,Juan-José Prieto-Gutiérrez	2021/01/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03339v1	ArXiv	This paper presents an analysis of the publication of datasets collected via Google Dataset Search, specialized in families of RNA viruses, whose terminology was obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) thesaurus developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The objective is to determine the scope and reuse capacity of the available data, determine the number of datasets and their free access, the proportion in reusable download formats, the main providers, their publication chronology, and to verify their scientific provenance. On the other hand, we also define possible relationships between the publication of datasets and the main pandemics that have occurred during the last 10 years. The results obtained highlight that only 52% of the datasets are related to scientific research, while an even smaller fraction (15%) are reusable. There is also an upward trend in the publication of datasets, especially related to the impact of the main epidemics, as clearly confirmed for the Ebola virus, Zika, SARS-CoV, H1N1, H1N5, and especially the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Finally, it is observed that the search engine has not yet implemented adequate methods for filtering and monitoring the datasets. These results reveal some of the difficulties facing open science in the dataset field.	835
AI- and HPC-enabled Lead Generation for SARS-CoV-2: Models and Processes  to Extract Druglike Molecules Contained in Natural Language Text	Zhi Hong,J. Gregory Pauloski,Logan Ward,Kyle Chard,Ben Blaiszik,Ian Foster	2021/01/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04617v1	ArXiv	Researchers worldwide are seeking to repurpose existing drugs or discover new drugs to counter the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A promising source of candidates for such studies is molecules that have been reported in the scientific literature to be drug-like in the context of coronavirus research. We report here on a project that leverages both human and artificial intelligence to detect references to drug-like molecules in free text. We engage non-expert humans to create a corpus of labeled text, use this labeled corpus to train a named entity recognition model, and employ the trained model to extract 10912 drug-like molecules from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) corpus of 198875 papers. Performance analyses show that our automated extraction model can achieve performance on par with that of non-expert humans.	836
Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in South Korea	Kwangmin Lee,Seongil Jo,Jaeyong Lee	2021/01/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11991v1	ArXiv	In $2020$, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported three rounds of surveys on seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in South Korea. We analyze the seroprevalence surveys using a Bayesian method with an informative prior distribution on the seroprevalence parameter, and the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. We construct the informative prior using the posterior distribution obtained from the clinical evaluation data based on the plaque reduction neutralization test. The constraint of the seroprevalence parameter induced from the known confirmed coronavirus 2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the proposed Bayesian model. We also prove that the confidence interval of the seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao's test can be the empty set, while the Bayesian method renders a reasonable interval estimator. As of the $30$th of October $2020$, the $95\%$ credible interval of the estimated SARS-CoV-2 positive population does not exceed $307,448$, approximately $0.6\%$ of the Korean population.	837
COVID-19: Detecting Depression Signals during Stay-At-Home Period	Jean Marie Tshimula,Belkacem Chikhaoui,Shengrui Wang	2021/02/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00597v1	ArXiv	The new coronavirus outbreak has been officially declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. To grapple with the rapid spread of this ongoing pandemic, most countries have banned indoor and outdoor gatherings and ordered their residents to stay home. Given the developing situation with coronavirus, mental health is an important challenge in our society today. In this paper, we discuss the investigation of social media postings to detect signals relevant to depression. To this end, we utilize topic modeling features and a collection of psycholinguistic and mental-well-being attributes to develop statistical models to characterize and facilitate representation of the more subtle aspects of depression. Furthermore, we predict whether signals relevant to depression are likely to grow significantly as time moves forward. Our best classifier yields F-1 scores as high as 0.8 and surpasses the utilized baseline by a considerable margin, 0.173. In closing, we propose several future research avenues.	838
DOPE: D-Optimal Pooling Experimental design with application for  SARS-CoV-2 screening	Yair Daon,Amit Huppert,Uri Obolski	2021/03/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03706v1	ArXiv	Testing individuals for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is crucial for curtailing transmission chains. Moreover, rapidly testing many potentially infected individuals is often a limiting factor in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks. Hence, pooling strategies, wherein individuals are grouped and tested simultaneously, are employed. We present a novel pooling strategy that implements D-Optimal Pooling Experimental design (DOPE). DOPE defines optimal pooled tests as those maximizing the mutual information between data and infection states. We estimate said mutual information via Monte-Carlo sampling and employ a discrete optimization heuristic for maximizing it. DOPE outperforms common pooling strategies both in terms of lower error rates and fewer tests utilized. DOPE holds several additional advantages: it provides posterior distributions of the probability of infection, rather than only binary classification outcomes; it naturally incorporates prior information of infection probabilities and test error rates; and finally, it can be easily extended to include other, newly discovered information regarding COVID-19. Hence, we believe that implementation of Bayesian D-optimal experimental design holds a great promise for the efforts of combating COVID-19 and other future pandemics.	839
Estimating intervention effects on infectious disease control: the  effect of community mobility reduction on Coronavirus spread	Andrew Giffin,Wenlong Gong,Suman Majumder,Ana G. Rappold,Brian J. Reich,Shu Yang	2021/03/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04417v2	ArXiv	Understanding the effects of interventions, such as restrictions on community and large group gatherings, is critical to controlling the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models are traditionally used to forecast the infection rates but do not provide insights into the causal effects of interventions. We propose a spatiotemporal model that estimates the causal effect of changes in community mobility (intervention) on infection rates. Using an approximation to the SIR model and incorporating spatiotemporal dependence, the proposed model estimates a direct and indirect (spillover) effect of intervention. Under an interference and treatment ignorability assumption, this model is able to estimate causal intervention effects, and additionally allows for spatial interference between locations. Reductions in community mobility were measured by cell phone movement data. The results suggest that the reductions in mobility decrease Coronavirus cases 4 to 7 weeks after the intervention.	840
A machine learning analysis of the relationship between some underlying  medical conditions and COVID-19 susceptibility	Mostafa Rezapour,Colin A. Varady	2021/12/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12901v2	ArXiv	For the past couple years, the Coronavirus, commonly known as COVID-19, has significantly affected the daily lives of all citizens residing in the United States by imposing several, fatal health risks that cannot go unnoticed. In response to the growing fear and danger COVID-19 inflicts upon societies in the USA, several vaccines and boosters have been created as a permanent remedy for individuals to take advantage of. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the COVID-19 vaccines and boosters and the total case count for the Coronavirus across multiple states in the USA. Additionally, this paper discusses the relationship between several, selected underlying health conditions with COVID-19. To discuss these relationships effectively, this paper will utilize statistical tests and machine learning methods for analysis and discussion purposes. Furthermore, this paper reflects upon conclusions made about the relationship between educational attainment, race, and COVID-19 and the possible connections that can be established with underlying health conditions, vaccination rates, and COVID-19 total case and death counts.	841
The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More  Infectious Than Initially Estimated	Steven Sanche,Yen Ting Lin,Chonggang Xu,Ethan Romero-Severson,Nicolas W. Hengartner,Ruian Ke	2020/02/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03268v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.	842
Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein  reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation loop as a distinguishing  feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS-like coronaviruses	Javier A. Jaimes,Nicole M. Andre,Jean K. Millet,Gary R. Whittaker	2020/02/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06196v1	ArXiv	The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.	843
Phylogenetic analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 reflected the several routes of introduction to Taiwan, the  United States, and Japan	Tomoko Matsuda,Hikoyu Suzuki,Norichika Ogata	2020/02/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08802v2	ArXiv	Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people. The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.	844
Inhibition of the Main Protease 3CL-pro of the Coronavirus Disease 19  via Structure-Based Ligand Design and Molecular Modeling	Marina Macchiagodena,Marco Pagliai,Piero Procacci	2020/02/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09937v2	ArXiv	We have applied a computational strategy, based on the synergy of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead compounds for the non-covalent inhibition of the main protease 3CL-pro of the SARS-Cov2 Coronavirus. Based on the recently resolved 6LU7 PDB structure, ligands were generated using a multimodal structure-based design and then optimally docked to the 6LU7 monomer. Docking calculations show that ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases, irrespectively of the protonation state of the catalytic CYS-HIS dyad. The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement. Molecular dynamics calculations fully confirm the stability in the 3CL-pro binding pocket of the most potent binder identified by docking, namely a chlorophenyl-pyridyl-carboxamide derivative.	845
Coronavirus Covid-19 spreading in Italy: optimizing an epidemiological  model with dynamic social distancing through Differential Evolution	I. De Falco,A. Della Cioppa,U. Scafuri,E. Tarantino	2020/04/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00553v3	ArXiv	The aim of this paper consists in the application of a recent epidemiological model, namely SEIR with Social Distancing (SEIR--SD), extended here through the definition of a social distancing function varying over time, to assess the situation related to the spreading of the coronavirus Covid--19 in Italy and in two of its most important regions, i.e., Lombardy and Campania. To profitably use this model, the most suitable values of its parameters must be found. The estimation of the SEIR--SD model parameters takes place here through the use of Differential Evolution, a heuristic optimization technique. In this way, we are able to evaluate for each of the three above-mentioned scenarios the daily number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading, the day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, and the day in which the infected cases will become very close to zero.	846
Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic by SIR model and machine learning  technics for forecasting	Babacar Mbaye Ndiaye,Lena Tendeng,Diaraf Seck	2020/04/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01574v1	ArXiv	This work is a trial in which we propose SIR model and machine learning tools to analyze the coronavirus pandemic in the real world. Based on the public data from \cite{datahub}, we estimate main key pandemic parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for the real world and specifically for Senegal. The coronavirus disease 2019, by World Health Organization, rapidly spread out in the whole China and then in the whole world. Under optimistic estimation, the pandemic in some countries will end soon, while for most part of countries in the world (US, Italy, etc.), the hit of anti-pandemic will be no later than the end of April.	847
Coronavirus Detection and Analysis on Chest CT with Deep Learning	Ophir Gozes,Maayan Frid-Adar,Nimrod Sagie,Huangqi Zhang,Wenbin Ji,Hayit Greenspan	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02640v1	ArXiv	"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, officially declared a global pandemic, has a severe impact on our daily lives. As of this writing there are approximately 197,188 confirmed cases of which 80,881 are in ""Mainland China"" with 7,949 deaths, a mortality rate of 3.4%. In order to support radiologists in this overwhelming challenge, we develop a deep learning based algorithm that can detect, localize and quantify severity of COVID-19 manifestation from chest CT scans. The algorithm is comprised of a pipeline of image processing algorithms which includes lung segmentation, 2D slice classification and fine grain localization. In order to further understand the manifestations of the disease, we perform unsupervised clustering of abnormal slices. We present our results on a dataset comprised of 110 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Zhejiang province, China."	848
The Impact of Public Safety Measures on the Spread of COVID-19 in the  United States Assessed By Causal Model-Based Projections of the Pandemic	Keshav Amla,Tarun Amla	2020/04/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03200v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. Since then, the disease has spread all over the world, with the United States becoming the country with the highest number of cases. Governments around the world have undertaken varying degrees of public safety measures, including recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting social distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the United States, while the response has varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these public safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain in effect, or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be controlled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences. In this paper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model. We find that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can, according to this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the total number of deaths to ~72 thousand. A 60 day lockdown can save countless lives.	849
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Classification using Deep Features Fusion and  Ranking Technique	Umut Ozkaya,Saban Ozturk,Mucahid Barstugan	2020/04/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03698v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged towards the end of 2019. World Health Organization (WHO) was identified it as a global epidemic. Consensus occurred in the opinion that using Computerized Tomography (CT) techniques for early diagnosis of pandemic disease gives both fast and accurate results. It was stated by expert radiologists that COVID-19 displays different behaviours in CT images. In this study, a novel method was proposed as fusing and ranking deep features to detect COVID-19 in early phase. 16x16 (Subset-1) and 32x32 (Subset-2) patches were obtained from 150 CT images to generate sub-datasets. Within the scope of the proposed method, 3000 patch images have been labelled as CoVID-19 and No finding for using in training and testing phase. Feature fusion and ranking method have been applied in order to increase the performance of the proposed method. Then, the processed data was classified with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). According to other pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models used in transfer learning, the proposed method shows high performance on Subset-2 with 98.27% accuracy, 98.93% sensitivity, 97.60% specificity, 97.63% precision, 98.28% F1-score and 96.54% Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metrics.	850
Modeling the transmission of new coronavirus in São Paulo State,  Brazil -- Assessing epidemiological impacts of isolating young and elder  persons	Hyun Mo Yang,Luis Pedro Lombardi Junior,Ariana Campos Yang	2020/04/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05715v1	ArXiv	We developed a mathematical model to describe the transmission of new coronavirus in the S\~ao Paulo State, Brazil. The model divided a community in subpopulations comprised by young and elder persons, in order to take into account higher risk of fatality among elder persons with severe CoViD-19. From data collected in the S\~ao Paulo State, we estimated the transmission and additional mortality rates, from which we calculated the basic reproduction number R0. From estimated parameters, estimation of the deaths due to CoViD-19 was three times lower than those found in literature. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied isolation rates of young and elder persons in order to assess their epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios focused mainly on evaluating the number of severe CoViD-19 cases and deaths due to this disease when isolation is introduced in a population.	851
Estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers underlying  epidemiological processes: a new statistical tool for the COVID-19 pandemic	Hyokyoung G. Hong,Yi Li	2020/04/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05730v3	ArXiv	The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly evolved into an unprecedented crisis. The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model and its variants have been used for modeling the pandemic. However, time-independent parameters in the classical models may not capture the dynamic transmission and removal processes, governed by virus containment strategies taken at various phases of the epidemic. Moreover, very few models account for possible inaccuracies of the reported cases. We propose a Poisson model with time-dependent transmission and removal rates to account for possible random errors in reporting and estimate a time-dependent disease reproduction number, which may be used to assess the effectiveness of virus control strategies. We apply our method to study the pandemic in several severely impacted countries, and analyze and forecast the evolving spread of the coronavirus. We have developed an interactive web application to facilitate readers' use of our method.	852
Mining Coronavirus (COVID-19) Posts in Social Media	Negin Karisani,Payam Karisani	2020/03/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06778v1	ArXiv	World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Before this and in late January, more specifically on January 27th, while the majority of the infection cases were still reported in China and a few cruise ships, we began crawling social media user postings using the Twitter search API. Our goal was to leverage machine learning and linguistic tools to better understand the impact of the outbreak in China. Unlike our initial expectation to monitor a local outbreak, COVID-19 rapidly spread across the globe. In this short article we report the preliminary results of our study on automatically detecting the positive reports of COVID-19 from social media user postings using state-of-the-art machine learning models.	853
The comparison of trends in Spain and the Nederland: a Dynamical  compartment model of the transmission of Coronavirus	Victoria Lopez,Milena Čukić	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09874v2	ArXiv	The recent spreading of coronavirus made many countries impose restrictions in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens. We developed a theoretical dynamical model based on compartmental SIR system with additional adjustment taken from Flow network and Markov chain frameworks to illustrate developments and trends based on publicly available data. Based on this Model, code in R was written and fed by stamped publicly available data from authorized governmental websites in Spain and in the Nederlands, to compare trends. Our results show that the 'peak' of infection is already behind us in both countries, but also demonstrate that there is a danger of rebound of a spread. It is obvious that measures imposed are giving the results, but we should be precarious of near future practices and developments since the majority of population will still be without immunity.	854
Deep Sentiment Classification and Topic Discovery on Novel Coronavirus  or COVID-19 Online Discussions: NLP Using LSTM Recurrent Neural Network  Approach	Hamed Jelodar,Yongli Wang,Rita Orji,Hucheng Huang	2020/04/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11695v1	ArXiv	Internet forums and public social media, such as online healthcare forums, provide a convenient channel for users (people/patients) concerned about health issues to discuss and share information with each other. In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease named COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in other parts of the world, the World Health Organization declared a state of emergency. In this paper, we used automated extraction of COVID-19 related discussions from social media and a natural language process (NLP) method based on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public opinions. Moreover, we also investigate how to use LSTM recurrent neural network for sentiment classification of COVID-19 comments. Our findings shed light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related decision-making.	855
Decoding SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution and ramification on COVID-19  diagnosis, vaccine, and medicine	Rui Wang,Yuta Hozumi,Changchuan Yin,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/04/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14114v1	ArXiv	Tremendous effort has been given to the development of diagnostic tests, preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Much of this development has been based on the reference genome collected on January 5, 2020. Based on the genotyping of 6156 genome samples collected up to April 24, 2020, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has had 4459 alarmingly mutations which can be clustered into five subtypes. We introduce mutation ratio and mutation $h$-index to characterize the protein conservativeness and unveil that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, main protease, and endoribonuclease protein are relatively conservative, while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and papain-like protease are relatively non-conservative. In particular, the nucleocapsid protein has more than half its genes changed in the past few months, signaling devastating impacts on the ongoing development of COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccines, and drugs.	856
Modeling the molecular impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the  renin-angiotensin system	Fabrizio Pucci,Philippe Bogaerts,Marianne Rooman	2020/06/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02772v2	ArXiv	SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection is mediated by the binding of its spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The study of RAS dysregulation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is fundamentally important for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors associated with COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and to design effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, we developed a mathematical model of RAS based on data regarding protein and peptide concentrations; the model was tested on clinical data from healthy normotensive and hypertensive individuals. We then used our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RAS, which we modeled through a down-regulation of ACE2 as a function of viral load. We also used it to predict the effect of RAS-targeting drugs, such as RAS-blockers, human recombinant ACE2, and angiotensin 1-7 peptide, on COVID-19 patients; the model predicted an improvement of the clinical outcome for some drugs and a worsening for others.	857
Coronavirus research before 2020 is more relevant than ever, especially  when interpreted for COVID-19	Mike Thelwall	2020/06/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03901v1	ArXiv	The speed with which biomedical researchers were able to identify and characterise COVID-19 was clearly due to prior research with other coronaviruses. Early epidemiological comparisons with two previous coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also made it easier to predict COVID-19's likely spread and lethality. This article assesses whether academic interest in prior coronavirus research has translated into interest in the primary source material, using Mendeley reader counts for early academic impact evidence. The results confirm that SARS and MERS research 2008-2017 experienced anomalously high increases in Mendeley readers in April-May 2020. Nevertheless, studies learning COVID-19 lessons from SARS and MERS or using them as a benchmark for COVID-19 have generated much more academic interest than primary studies of SARS or MERS. Thus, research that interprets prior relevant research for new diseases when they are discovered seems to be particularly important to help researchers to understand its implications in the new context.	858
Disinformation and Misinformation on Twitter during the Novel  Coronavirus Outbreak	Binxuan Huang,Kathleen M. Carley	2020/06/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04278v1	ArXiv	"As the novel coronavirus spread globally, a growing public panic was expressed over the internet. We examine the public discussion concerning COVID-19 on Twitter. We use a dataset of 67 million tweets from 12 million users collected between January 29, 2020 and March 4, 2020. We categorize users based on their home countries, social identities, and political orientation. We find that news media, government officials, and individual news reporters posted a majority of influential tweets, while the most influential ones are still written by regular users. Tweets mentioning ""fake news"" URLs and disinformation story-lines are also more likely to be spread by regular users. Unlike real news and normal tweets, tweets containing URLs pointing to ""fake news"" sites are most likely to be retweeted within the source country and so are less likely to spread internationally."	859
Is SARS-CoV-2 a new Frankenstein monster virus?	Mohammed A. El-Magd	2020/06/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08608v1	ArXiv	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus of beta coronavirus genus originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulted in the pandemic spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. This genus also contains SARS-CoV (originated in China 2002-2003) and MERS-CoV (found in Saudi Arabia 2012). The nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV (with approximately 80% identity) than to MERS-CoV. Despite these similarities, SARS-CoV-2 has two main features over the other coronaviruses. The first is the high contagious rate and the second is the immune response evasion. The higher transmission ability makes this virus quickly spread worldwide with a high mortality rate and more economic losses. This review will provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of some viral and host cell factors in higher transmission and contagious spread of SARS-CoV-2.	860
Review of COVID-19 Antibody Therapies	Jiahui Chen,Kaifu Gao,Rui Wang,Duc Duy Nguyen,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/06/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10584v1	ArXiv	Under the global health emergency caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), efficient and specific therapies are urgently needed. Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop and as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and thus attract much attention in the past few months. This work reviews seven existing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with three-dimensional (3D) structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV are evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared with those of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis (TDA), a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the aforementioned fourteen antibody-antigen complexes. The current COVID-19 antibody clinical trials, which are not limited to the S protein target, are also reviewed.	861
COVID-CXNet: Detecting COVID-19 in Frontal Chest X-ray Images using Deep  Learning	Arman Haghanifar,Mahdiyar Molahasani Majdabadi,Younhee Choi,S. Deivalakshmi,Seokbum Ko	2020/06/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13807v2	ArXiv	One of the primary clinical observations for screening the infectious by the novel coronavirus is capturing a chest x-ray image. In most of the patients, a chest x-ray contains abnormalities, such as consolidation, which are the results of COVID-19 viral pneumonia. In this study, research is conducted on efficiently detecting imaging features of this type of pneumonia using deep convolutional neural networks in a large dataset. It is demonstrated that simple models, alongside the majority of pretrained networks in the literature, focus on irrelevant features for decision-making. In this paper, numerous chest x-ray images from various sources are collected, and the largest publicly accessible dataset is prepared. Finally, using the transfer learning paradigm, the well-known CheXNet model is utilized for developing COVID-CXNet. This powerful model is capable of detecting the novel coronavirus pneumonia based on relevant and meaningful features with precise localization. COVID-CXNet is a step towards a fully automated and robust COVID-19 detection system.	862
Topological data analysis model for the spread of the coronavirus	Yiran Chen,Ismar Volic	2020/08/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05989v1	ArXiv	We apply topological data analysis, specifically the Mapper algorithm, to the U.S. COVID-19 data. The resulting Mapper graphs provide visualizations of the pandemic that are more complete than those supplied by other, more standard methods. They encode a variety of geometric features of the data cloud created from geographic information, time progression, and the number of COVID-19 cases. They reflect the development of the pandemic across all of the U.S. and capture the growth rates as well as the regional prominence of hot-spots. The Mapper graphs allow for easy comparisons across time and space and have the potential of becoming a useful predictive tool for the spread of the coronavirus.	863
Smart Healthcare for Diabetes: A COVID-19 Perspective	Amit M. Joshi,Urvashi P. Shukla,Saraju P. Mohanty	2020/07/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11153v1	ArXiv	Diabetes is considered as an critical comorbidity linked with the latest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which spreads through Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). The diabetic patients have higher threat of infection from novel corona virus. Depending on the region in the globe, 20% to 50% of patients infected with COVID-19 pandemic had diabetes. The current article discussed the risk associated with diabetic patients and also recommendation for controlling diabetes during this pandemic situation. The article also discusses the case study of COVID-19 at various regions around the globe and the preventive actions taken by various countries to control the effect from the virus. The article presents several smart healthcare solutions for the diabetes patients to have glucose insulin control for the protection against COVID-19.	864
Did circoviruses intermediate the recombination between bat and pangolin  coronaviruses, yielding SARS-CoV-2?	Nabil Abid,Giovanni Chillemi,Ahmed Rebai	2020/09/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00531v1	ArXiv	Since the first reports of a coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, scientists are working around the clock to find sound answers to the issue of its origin. While the number of scientific articles on SARS-CoV-2 is increasing, there are still many gaps as to its origin. All studies failed to find a coronavirus in other animals that is more similar to human SARS-COV2 than the bat virus, considered to be the primary reservoir. In this paper we address a new hypothesis, based on a possible recombination between a DNA and SARS-CoV viruses, to explain the rise of SRAS-CoV-2. By comparing SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs with circoviruses (CVs), we found strong sequence similarity of the genomic region at the 3-end of Bat-CoV ORF1a and the origin of replication (Ori) of porcine CV type 2 (PCV2), as well as similar RNA secondary structures of the region encompassing the cleavage site of CoV S gene with the PCV2 Ori. This constitutes a primary evidence that supports a possible recombination, which occurrence might explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2.	865
Infectious Disease Transmission via Aerosol Propagation from a Molecular  Communication Perspective: Shannon Meets Coronavirus	Max Schurwanz,Peter Adam Hoeher,Sunasheer Bhattacharjee,Martin Damrath,Lukas Stratmann,Falko Dressler	2020/10/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00290v3	ArXiv	Molecular communication is not only able to mimic biological and chemical communication mechanisms, but also provides a theoretical framework for viral infection processes. In this tutorial, aerosol and droplet transmission is modeled as a multiuser scenario with mobile nodes, related to broadcasting and relaying. In contrast to data communication systems, in the application of pathogen-laden aerosol transmission, mutual information between nodes should be minimized. Towards this goal, several countermeasures are reasoned. The findings are supported by experimental results and by an advanced particle simulation tool. This work is inspired by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but also applicable to other airborne infectious diseases like influenza.	866
NIT COVID-19 at WNUT-2020 Task 2: Deep Learning Model RoBERTa for  Identify Informative COVID-19 English Tweets	Jagadeesh M S,Alphonse P J A	2020/11/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05551v1	ArXiv	This paper presents the model submitted by the NIT_COVID-19 team for identified informative COVID-19 English tweets at WNUT-2020 Task2. This shared task addresses the problem of automatically identifying whether an English tweet related to informative (novel coronavirus) or not. These informative tweets provide information about recovered, confirmed, suspected, and death cases as well as the location or travel history of the cases. The proposed approach includes pre-processing techniques and pre-trained RoBERTa with suitable hyperparameters for English coronavirus tweet classification. The performance achieved by the proposed model for shared task WNUT 2020 Task2 is 89.14% in the F1-score metric.	867
Extracting COVID-19 Diagnoses and Symptoms From Clinical Text: A New  Annotated Corpus and Neural Event Extraction Framework	Kevin Lybarger,Mari Ostendorf,Matthew Thompson,Meliha Yetisgen	2020/12/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00974v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Although much has been learned about the novel coronavirus since its emergence, there are many open questions related to tracking its spread, describing symptomology, predicting the severity of infection, and forecasting healthcare utilization. Free-text clinical notes contain critical information for resolving these questions. Data-driven, automatic information extraction models are needed to use this text-encoded information in large-scale studies. This work presents a new clinical corpus, referred to as the COVID-19 Annotated Clinical Text (CACT) Corpus, which comprises 1,472 notes with detailed annotations characterizing COVID-19 diagnoses, testing, and clinical presentation. We introduce a span-based event extraction model that jointly extracts all annotated phenomena, achieving high performance in identifying COVID-19 and symptom events with associated assertion values (0.83-0.97 F1 for events and 0.73-0.79 F1 for assertions). In a secondary use application, we explored the prediction of COVID-19 test results using structured patient data (e.g. vital signs and laboratory results) and automatically extracted symptom information. The automatically extracted symptoms improve prediction performance, beyond structured data alone.	868
ArCorona: Analyzing Arabic Tweets in the Early Days of Coronavirus  (COVID-19) Pandemic	Hamdy Mubarak,Sabit Hassan	2020/12/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01462v3	ArXiv	Over the past few months, there were huge numbers of circulating tweets and discussions about Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Arab region. It is important for policy makers and many people to identify types of shared tweets to better understand public behavior, topics of interest, requests from governments, sources of tweets, etc. It is also crucial to prevent spreading of rumors and misinformation about the virus or bad cures. To this end, we present the largest manually annotated dataset of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19. We describe annotation guidelines, analyze our dataset and build effective machine learning and transformer based models for classification.	869
Space observation on detoxing the unhealthy air quality during COVID-19  pandemic in India	Prabhat Kumar,Rohit Kumar Kasera,S Suresh	2020/11/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03847v1	ArXiv	The purpose of this study has extremely dedicated to exposing the correlation between coronavirus pandemic and space observation on unhealthy air quality in India. The world has undergone lockdown to break the chain of coronavirus infection. The Air Quality Index (AQI) has started to improve after the commencement of lockdown due to industrial and transportation sectors temporally closed. This study compiled the data recently released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), ESA (European Space Agency), and ISRO (Indian Space and Research Organization). In this paper, we have discussed the space observation on Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), PM2.5, and PM10 influenced the air quality across the various region of India. We analyzed the detoxing of air quality before and during the lockdown period over the same time the frame of current and the previous year. The result has shown a positive impact on the detoxing of unhealthy air quality during lockdown stated as the emission of NO2 has reduced to 40% - 50% and optical level of aerosol indexed at low compared to the last 20 years in northern India.	870
SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Data Compression Benchmark	Innar Liiv	2020/12/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12013v1	ArXiv	This paper introduces a lossless data compression competition that benchmarks solutions (computer programs) by the compressed size of the 44,981 concatenated SARS-CoV-2 sequences, with a total uncompressed size of 1,339,868,341 bytes. The data, downloaded on 13 December 2020, from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 data hub of ncbi.nlm.nih.gov is presented in FASTA and 2Bit format. The aim of this competition is to encourage multidisciplinary research to find the shortest lossless description for the sequences and to demonstrate that data compression can serve as an objective and repeatable measure to align scientific breakthroughs across disciplines. The shortest description of the data is the best model; therefore, further reducing the size of this description requires a fundamental understanding of the underlying context and data. This paper presents preliminary results with multiple well-known compression algorithms for baseline measurements, and insights regarding promising research avenues. The competition's progress will be reported at \url{https://coronavirus.innar.com}, and the benchmark is open for all to participate and contribute.	871
UMAP-assisted $K$-means clustering of large-scale SARS-CoV-2 mutation  datasets	Yuta Hozumi,Rui Wang,Changchuan Yin,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/12/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15268v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a worldwide devastating effect. The understanding of evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of paramount importance for the COVID-19 control, combating, and prevention. Due to the rapid growth of both the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and the number of unique mutations, the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates faces an emergent large-data challenge. We introduce a dimension-reduced $k$-means clustering strategy to tackle this challenge. We examine the performance and effectiveness of three dimension-reduction algorithms: principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). By using four benchmark datasets, we found that UMAP is the best-suited technique due to its stable, reliable, and efficient performance, its ability to improve clustering accuracy, especially for large Jaccard distanced-based datasets, and its superior clustering visualization. The UMAP-assisted $k$-means clustering enables us to shed light on increasingly large datasets from SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates.	872
Interactive SARS-CoV-2 mutation timemaps	Rene L. Warren,Inanc Birol	2020/12/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15697v1	ArXiv	As the year 2020 draws to an end, several new strains have been reported for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that has afflicted us all this past year. However, it is difficult to comprehend the scale, in sequence space, geographical location and time, at which SARS-CoV-2 mutates and evolves in its human hosts. To get an appreciation for the rapid evolution of the coronavirus, we built interactive scalable vector graphics maps that show daily nucleotide variations in genomes from the six most populated continents compared to that of the initial, ground-zero SARS-CoV-2 isolate sequenced at the beginning of the year. Availability: Mutation time maps are available from https://bcgsc.github.io/SARS2/	873
An Interaction Neyman-Scott Point Process Model for Coronavirus  Disease-19	J. Park,W. Chang,B. Choi	2021/02/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02999v1	ArXiv	With rapid transmission, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to over 2 million deaths worldwide, posing significant societal challenges. Understanding the spatial patterns of patient visits and detecting the local spreading events are crucial to controlling disease outbreaks. We analyze highly detailed COVID-19 contact tracing data collected from Seoul, which provides a unique opportunity to understand the mechanism of patient visit occurrence. Analyzing contact tracing data is challenging because patient visits show strong clustering patterns while clusters of events may have complex interaction behavior. To account for such behaviors, we develop a novel interaction Neyman-Scott process that regards the observed patient visit events as offsprings generated from a parent spreading event. Inference for such models is complicated since the likelihood involves intractable normalizing functions. To address this issue, we embed an auxiliary variable algorithm into our Markov chain Monte Carlo. We fit our model to several simulated and real data examples under different outbreak scenarios and show that our method can describe spatial patterns of patient visits well. We also provide visualization tools that can inform public health interventions for infectious diseases such as social distancing.	874
A fractional-order model for CoViD-19 dynamics with reinfection and the  importance of quarantine	João P. S. Maurício de Carvalho,Beatriz Moreira-Pinto	2021/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04301v3	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among many symptoms, cough, fever and tiredness are the most common. People over 60 years old and with associated comorbidities are most likely to develop a worsening health condition. This paper proposes a non-integer order model to describe the dynamics of CoViD-19 in a standard population. The model incorporates the reinfection rate in the individuals recovered from the disease. Numerical simulations are performed for different values of the order of the fractional derivative and of reinfection rate. The results are discussed from a biological point of view.	875
Masked Face Recognition using ResNet-50	Bishwas Mandal,Adaeze Okeukwu,Yihong Theis	2021/04/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08997v1	ArXiv	Over the last twenty years, there have seen several outbreaks of different coronavirus diseases across the world. These outbreaks often led to respiratory tract diseases and have proved to be fatal sometimes. Currently, we are facing an elusive health crisis with the emergence of COVID-19 disease of the coronavirus family. One of the modes of transmission of COVID- 19 is airborne transmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets released by an infected person through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, or sneezing. Hence, public health officials have mandated the use of face masks which can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs, commonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents an arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human faces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are forced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same problem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately identifying people with face-masks. In this paper, the authors train a ResNet-50 based architecture that performs well at recognizing masked faces. The outcome of this study could be seamlessly integrated into existing face recognition programs that are designed to detect faces for security verification purposes.	876
Measuring economic activity from space: a case study using flying  airplanes and COVID-19	Mauricio Pamplona Segundo,Allan Pinto,Rodrigo Minetto,Ricardo da Silva Torres,Sudeep Sarkar	2021/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10345v1	ArXiv	This work introduces a novel solution to measure economic activity through remote sensing for a wide range of spatial areas. We hypothesized that disturbances in human behavior caused by major life-changing events leave signatures in satellite imagery that allows devising relevant image-based indicators to estimate their impacts and support decision-makers. We present a case study for the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, which imposed severe mobility restrictions and caused worldwide disruptions, using flying airplane detection around the 30 busiest airports in Europe to quantify and analyze the lockdown's effects and post-lockdown recovery. Our solution won the Rapid Action Coronavirus Earth observation (RACE) upscaling challenge, sponsored by the European Space Agency and the European Commission, and now integrates the RACE dashboard. This platform combines satellite data and artificial intelligence to promote a progressive and safe reopening of essential activities.

Why and How Coronavirus Has Evolved to Be Uniquely Contagious, with  Uniquely Successful Stable Vaccines	Marcelo A. Moret,Gilney F. Zebende,J. C. Phillips	2021/07/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07047v1	ArXiv	Spike proteins, 1200 amino acids, are divided into two nearly equal parts, S1 and S2. We review here phase transition theory, implemented quantitatively by thermodynamic scaling. The theory explains the evolution of Coronavirus extremely high contagiousness caused by a few mutations from CoV2003 to CoV2019 identified among hundreds in S1. The theory previously predicted the unprecedented success of spike-based vaccines. Here we analyze impressive successes by McClellan et al., 2020, in stabilizing their original S2P vaccine to Hexapro. Hexapro has expanded the two proline mutations of S2P, 2017, to six combined proline mutations in S2. Their four new mutations are the result of surveying 100 possibilities in their detailed structure-based context Our analysis, based on only sparse publicly available data, suggests new proline mutations could improve the Hexapro combination to Octapro or beyond.	878
Analysis of External Content in the Vaccination Discussion on Twitter	Richard Kuzma,Iain J. Cruickshank,Kathleen M. Carley	2021/07/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09183v2	ArXiv	The spread of coronavirus and anti-vaccine conspiracies online hindered public health responses to the pandemic. We examined the content of external articles shared on Twitter from February to June 2020 to understand how conspiracy theories and fake news competed with legitimate sources of information. Examining external content--articles, rather than social media posts--is a novel methodology that allows for non-social media specific analysis of misinformation, tracking of changing narratives over time, and determining which types of resources (government, news, scientific, or dubious) dominate the pandemic vaccine conversation. We find that distinct narratives emerge, those narratives change over time, and lack of government and scientific messaging on coronavirus created an information vacuum filled by both traditional news and conspiracy theories.	879
Segmentation of Lungs COVID Infected Regions by Attention Mechanism and  Synthetic Data	Parham Yazdekhasty,Ali Zindari,Zahra Nabizadeh-ShahreBabak,Pejman Khadivi,Nader Karimi,Shadrokh Samavi	2021/08/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08895v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Fatalities could decrease if every patient could get suitable treatment by the healthcare system. Machine learning, especially computer vision methods based on deep learning, can help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat COVID-19 infected cases more efficiently. Hence, infected patients can get better service from the healthcare system and decrease the number of deaths caused by the coronavirus. This research proposes a method for segmenting infected lung regions in a CT image. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism is used to detect infected areas with complex patterns. Attention blocks improve the segmentation accuracy by focusing on informative parts of the image. Furthermore, a generative adversarial network generates synthetic images for data augmentation and expansion of small available datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to some existing procedures.	880
SAI-BA-IoMT: Secure AI-Based Blockchain-Assisted Internet of Medical  Things Tool to Moderate the Outbreak of COVID-19 Crisis	Mahender Kumar,Ruby Rani	2021/08/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09539v1	ArXiv	Recently, an infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been reported in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread worldwide within a couple of months. On May 16, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected several countries in the world. In this article, we present how the amalgamation of blockchain, cryptography, internet of medical things (IoMT), and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can address such an issue in the event of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we propose a secure AI-based blockchain-assisted IoMT (SAI-BA-IoMT) model for the healthcare system in the COVID-19 crisis. The paper also examines the post-corona crisis that the world could be experienced after the pandemic. Additionally, we exhibit the potential applications of the proposed model to resolve the difficulties originated from coronavirus.	881
Effects of surface charge and environmental factors on the electrostatic  interaction of fiber with virus-like particle: A case of coronavirus	D. N. Dung,A. D. Phan,T. T. Nguyen,V. D. Lam	2021/10/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01037v1	ArXiv	We propose a theoretical model to elucidate intermolecular electrostatic interactions between a virus and a substrate. Our model treats the virus as a homogeneous particle having surface charge and the polymer fiber of the respirator as a charged plane. Electric potentials surrounding the virus and fiber are influenced by the surface charge distribution of the virus. We use Poisson-Boltzmann equations to calculate electric potentials. Then, Derjaguin's approximation and a linear superposition of the potential function are extended to determine the electrostatic force. In this work, we apply this model for coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 case and numerical results quantitatively agree with prior simulation. We find that the influence of fiber's potential on the surface charge of the virus is important and is considered in interaction calculations to obtain better accuracy. The electrostatic interaction significantly decays with increasing separation distance, and this curve becomes steeper when adding more salt. Although the interaction force increases with heating, one can observe the repulsive-attractive transition when the environment is acidic.	882
On the association between COVID-19 vaccination levels and incidence and  lethality rates at a regional scale in Spain	Álvaro Briz-Redón,Ángel Serrano-Aroca	2021/10/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10439v1	ArXiv	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to the deepest global health and economic crisis of the current century. This dramatic situation has forced the public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Currently, almost 80% of the population are vaccinated with the required number of doses in Spain. Thus, in this paper, COVID-19 incidence and lethality rates are analyzed through a segmented spatio-temporal regression model that allows studying if there is an association between a certain vaccination level and a change (in mean) in either the incidence or the lethality rates. Spatial dependency is included by considering the Besag-York-Molli\'e model, whereas natural cubic splines are used for capturing the temporal structure of the data. Lagged effects between the exposure and the outcome are also taken into account. The results suggest that COVID-19 vaccination has not allowed yet (as of September 2021) to observe a consistent reduction in incidence levels at a regional scale in Spain. In contrast, the lethality rates have displayed a declining tendency which has associated with vaccination levels above 50%.	883
Deep learning for drug repurposing: methods, databases, and applications	Xiaoqin Pan,Xuan Lin,Dongsheng Cao,Xiangxiang Zeng,Philip S. Yu,Lifang He,Ruth Nussinov,Feixiong Cheng	2022/02/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05145v1	ArXiv	Drug development is time-consuming and expensive. Repurposing existing drugs for new therapies is an attractive solution that accelerates drug development at reduced experimental costs, specifically for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, comprehensively obtaining and productively integrating available knowledge and big biomedical data to effectively advance deep learning models is still challenging for drug repurposing in other complex diseases. In this review, we introduce guidelines on how to utilize deep learning methodologies and tools for drug repurposing. We first summarized the commonly used bioinformatics and pharmacogenomics databases for drug repurposing. Next, we discuss recently developed sequence-based and graph-based representation approaches as well as state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods. Finally, we present applications of drug repurposing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and outline its future challenges.	884
COVIBOT: A Smart Chatbot for Assistance and E-Awareness during COVID-19  Pandemic	Maha Driss,Iman Almomani,Leen Alahmadi,Linah Alhajjam,Raghad Alharbi,Shahad Alanazi	2022/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07851v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus pandemic has spread over the past two years in our highly connected and information-dense society. Nonetheless, disseminating accurate and up-to-date information on the spread of this pandemic remains a challenge. In this context, opting for a solution based on conversational artificial intelligence, also known under the name of the chatbot, is proving to be an unavoidable solution, especially since it has already shown its effectiveness in fighting the coronavirus crisis in several countries. This work proposes to design and implement a smart chatbot on the theme of COVID-19, called COVIBOT, which will be useful in the context of Saudi Arabia. COVIBOT is a generative-based contextual chatbot, which is built using machine learning APIs that are offered by the cloud-based Azure Cognitive Services. Two versions of COVIBOT are offered: English and Arabic versions. Use cases of COVIBOT are tested and validated using a scenario-based approach.	885
Calibrated Bagging Deep Learning for Image Semantic Segmentation: A Case  Study on COVID-19 Chest X-ray Image	Lucy Nwosu,Xiangfang Li,Lijun Qian,Seungchan Kim,Xishuang Dong	2022/05/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00002v1	ArXiv	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Imaging tests such as chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) can provide useful information to clinical staff for facilitating a diagnosis of COVID-19 in a more efficient and comprehensive manner. As a breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning has been applied to perform COVID-19 infection region segmentation and disease classification by analyzing CXR and CT data. However, prediction uncertainty of deep learning models for these tasks, which is very important to safety-critical applications like medical image processing, has not been comprehensively investigated. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble deep learning model through integrating bagging deep learning and model calibration to not only enhance segmentation performance, but also reduce prediction uncertainty. The proposed method has been validated on a large dataset that is associated with CXR image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the segmentation performance, as well as decrease prediction uncertainties.	886
Deep Radiomic Analysis for Predicting Coronavirus Disease 2019 in  Computerized Tomography and X-ray Images	Ahmad Chaddad,Lama Hassan,Christian Desrosiers	2022/06/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01903v1	ArXiv	This paper proposes to encode the distribution of features learned from a convolutional neural network using a Gaussian Mixture Model. These parametric features, called GMM-CNN, are derived from chest computed tomography and X-ray scans of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. We use the proposed GMM-CNN features as input to a robust classifier based on random forests to differentiate between COVID-19 and other pneumonia cases. Our experiments assess the advantage of GMM-CNN features compared to standard CNN classification on test images. Using a random forest classifier (80\% samples for training; 20\% samples for testing), GMM-CNN features encoded with two mixture components provided a significantly better performance than standard CNN classification (p\,$<$\,0.05). Specifically, our method achieved an accuracy in the range of 96.00\,--\,96.70\% and an area under the ROC curve in the range of 99.29\,--\,99.45\%, with the best performance obtained by combining GMM-CNN features from both computed tomography and X-ray images. Our results suggest that the proposed GMM-CNN features could improve the prediction of COVID-19 in chest computed tomography and X-ray scans.	887
Machine Learning Application in Health	Ghadah Alshabana,Marjn Sadati,Thao Tran,Michael Thompson,Ashritha Chitimalla	2022/06/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06228v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus can be transmitted through the air by close proximity to infected persons. Commercial aircraft are a likely way to both transmit the virus among passengers and move the virus between locations. The importance of learning about where and how coronavirus has entered the United States will help further our understanding of the disease. Air travelers can come from countries or areas with a high rate of infection and may very well be at risk of being exposed to the virus. Therefore, as they reach the United States, the virus could easily spread. On our analysis, we utilized machine learning to determine if the number of flights into the Washington DC Metro Area had an effect on the number of cases and deaths reported in the city and surrounding area.	888
A Spatio-Temporal Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Coronavirus  Disease-19	Jaewoo Park,Seorim Yi,Won Chang,Jorge Mateu	2022/07/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06587v1	ArXiv	Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential to construct public health interventions. Spatially referenced data can provide richer opportunities to understand the mechanism of the disease spread compared to the more often encountered aggregated count data. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model to analyze confirmed cases of COVID-19 in an urban environment. Our method can detect unobserved cluster centers of the epidemics, and estimate the space-time range of the clusters that are useful to construct a warning system. Furthermore, our model can measure the impact of different types of landmarks in the city, which provides an intuitive explanation of disease spreading sources from different time points. To efficiently capture the temporal dynamics of the disease patterns, we employ a sequential approach that uses the posterior distribution of the parameters for the previous time step as the prior information for the current time step. This approach enables us to incorporate time dependence into our model in a computationally efficient manner without complicating the model structure. We also develop a model assessment by comparing the data with theoretical densities, and outline the goodness-of-fit of our fitted model.	889
Machine Learning Prediction of COVID-19 Severity Levels From Salivaomics  Data	Aaron Wang,Feng Li,Samantha Chiang,Jennifer Fulcher,Otto Yang,David Wong,Fang Wei	2022/07/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07274v1	ArXiv	The clinical spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the strain of coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, is broad, extending from asymptomatic infection to severe immunopulmonary reactions that, if not categorized properly, may be life-threatening. Researchers rate COVID-19 patients on a scale from 1 to 8 according to the severity level of COVID-19, 1 being healthy and 8 being extremely sick, based on a multitude of factors including number of clinic visits, days since the first sign of symptoms, and more. However, there are two issues with the current state of severity level designation. Firstly, there exists variation among researchers in determining these patient scores, which may lead to improper treatment. Secondly, researchers use a variety of metrics to determine patient severity level, including metrics involving plasma collection that require invasive procedures. This project aims to remedy both issues by introducing a machine learning framework that unifies severity level designations based on noninvasive saliva biomarkers. Our results show that we can successfully use machine learning on salivaomics data to predict the severity level of COVID-19 patients, indicating the presence of viral load using saliva biomarkers.	890
A Large-Scale Analysis of Persian Tweets Regarding Covid-19 Vaccination	Taha ShabaniMirzaei,Houmaan Chamani,Amirhossein Abaskohi,Zhivar Sourati Hassan Zadeh,Behnam Bahrak	2023/02/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04511v3	ArXiv	The Covid-19 pandemic had an enormous effect on our lives, especially on people's interactions. By introducing Covid-19 vaccines, both positive and negative opinions were raised over the subject of taking vaccines or not. In this paper, using data gathered from Twitter, including tweets and user profiles, we offer a comprehensive analysis of public opinion in Iran about the Coronavirus vaccines. For this purpose, we applied a search query technique combined with a topic modeling approach to extract vaccine-related tweets. We utilized transformer-based models to classify the content of the tweets and extract themes revolving around vaccination. We also conducted an emotion analysis to evaluate the public happiness and anger around this topic. Our results demonstrate that Covid-19 vaccination has attracted considerable attention from different angles, such as governmental issues, safety or hesitancy, and side effects. Moreover, Coronavirus-relevant phenomena like public vaccination and the rate of infection deeply impacted public emotional status and users' interactions.	891
Bayesian Unit-level Models for Longitudinal Survey Data under  Informative Sampling: An Analysis of Expected Job Loss Using the Household  Pulse Survey	Daniel Vedensky,Paul A. Parker,Scott H. Holan	2023/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07897v1	ArXiv	"The Household Pulse Survey (HPS), recently released by the U.S. Census Bureau, gathers timely information about the societal and economic impacts of coronavirus. The first phase of the survey was quickly launched one month after the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and ran for 12 weeks. To track the immediate impact of the pandemic, individual respondents during this phase were re-sampled for up to three consecutive weeks. Motivated by expected job loss during the pandemic, using public-use microdata, this work proposes unit-level, model-based estimators that incorporate longitudinal dependence at both the response and domain level. In particular, using a pseudo-likelihood, we consider a Bayesian hierarchical unit-level, model-based approach for both Gaussian and binary response data under informative sampling. To facilitate construction of these model-based estimates, we develop an efficient Gibbs sampler. An empirical simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed approach to models that do not account for unit-level longitudinal correlation. Finally, using public-use HPS micro-data, we provide an analysis of ""expected job loss"" that compares both design-based and model-based estimators and demonstrates superior performance for the proposed model-based approaches."	892
Exploring Spatial-Temporal Variations of Public Discourse on Social  Media: A Case Study on the First Wave of the Coronavirus Pandemic in Italy	Anslow Michael,Galletti Martina	2023/06/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16031v1	ArXiv	This paper proposes a methodology for exploring how linguistic behaviour on social media can be used to explore societal reactions to important events such as those that transpired during the SARS CoV2 pandemic. In particular, where spatial and temporal aspects of events are important features. Our methodology consists of grounding spatial-temporal categories in tweet usage trends using time-series analysis and clustering. Salient terms in each category were then identified through qualitative comparative analysis based on scaled f-scores aggregated into hand-coded categories. To exemplify this approach, we conducted a case study on the first wave of the coronavirus in Italy. We used our proposed methodology to explore existing psychological observations which claimed that physical distance from events affects what is communicated about them. We confirmed these findings by showing that the epicentre of the disease and peripheral regions correspond to clear time-series clusters and that those living in the epicentre of the SARS CoV2 outbreak were more focused on solidarity and policy than those from more peripheral regions. Furthermore, we also found that temporal categories corresponded closely to policy changes during the handling of the pandemic.	893
Prediction and analysis of Coronavirus Disease 2019	Lin Jia,Kewen Li,Yu Jiang,Xin Guo,Ting zhao	2020/03/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05447v2	ArXiv	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was found in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. WHO officially named this coronavirus as COVID-19. Since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12, 2019, China has reported a total of 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020. Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19 epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e., Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the situation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the three models, the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447 in Wuhan,12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas and 80261-85140 in China respectively. The total death toll is 2502-5108 in Wuhan, 107-125 in Non-Hubei areas and 3150-6286 in China respetively. COVID-19 will be over p robably in late-April, 2020 in Wuhan and before late-March, 2020 in other areas respectively.	894
A Novel AI-enabled Framework to Diagnose Coronavirus COVID 19 using  Smartphone Embedded Sensors: Design Study	Halgurd S. Maghdid,Kayhan Zrar Ghafoor,Ali Safaa Sadiq,Kevin Curran,Danda B. Rawat,Khaled Rabie	2020/03/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07434v2	ArXiv	Coronaviruses are a famous family of viruses that cause illness in both humans and animals. The new type of coronavirus COVID-19 was firstly discovered in Wuhan, China. However, recently, the virus has widely spread in most of the world and causing a pandemic according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the COVID-19. There are many mechanisms to detect coronavirus including clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID-19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost, taking time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is proposed to detect COVID-19 using built-in smartphone sensors. The proposal provides a low-cost solution, since most of radiologists have already held smartphones for different daily-purposes. Not only that but also ordinary people can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection purposes. Nowadays Smartphones are powerful with existing computation-rich processors, memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras, microphone, temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor, humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors signal measurements to predict the grade of severity of the pneumonia as well as predicting the result of the disease.	895
$α$-Satellite: An AI-driven System and Benchmark Datasets for  Hierarchical Community-level Risk Assessment to Help Combat COVID-19	Yanfang Ye,Shifu Hou,Yujie Fan,Yiyue Qian,Yiming Zhang,Shiyu Sun,Qian Peng,Kenneth Laparo	2020/03/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12232v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus and its deadly outbreak have posed grand challenges to human society: as of March 26, 2020, there have been 85,377 confirmed cases and 1,293 reported deaths in the United States; and the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) - which has infected more than 531,000 people with more than 24,000 deaths in at least 171 countries - a global pandemic. A growing number of areas reporting local sub-national community transmission would represent a significant turn for the worse in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which points to an urgent need for expanded surveillance so we can better understand the spread of COVID-19 and thus better respond with actionable strategies for community mitigation. By advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the large-scale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g., disease related data from official public health organizations, demographic data, mobility data, and user geneated data from social media), in this work, we propose and develop an AI-driven system (named $\alpha$-Satellite}, as an initial offering, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment to assist with the development of strategies for combating the fast evolving COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, given a specific location (either user input or automatic positioning), the developed system will automatically provide risk indexes associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state, county, city, specific location) to enable individuals to select appropriate actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible. The developed system and the generated benchmark datasets have been made publicly accessible through our website. The system description and disclaimer are also available in our website.	896
Deposition distribution of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the human  airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol	Balázs G. Madas,Péter Füri,Árpád Farkas,Attila Nagy,Aladár Czitrovszky,Imre Balásházy,Gusztáv G. Schay,Alpár Horváth	2020/05/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05882v1	ArXiv	The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways.

Deep Learning for Reliable Classification of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS  from Chest X-Ray Images	Anas Tahir,Yazan Qiblawey,Amith Khandakar,Tawsifur Rahman,Uzair Khurshid,Farayi Musharavati,M. T. Islam,Serkan Kiranyaz,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury	2020/05/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11524v6	ArXiv	Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and quickly spreading Coronavirus infestation. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which outbreak in 2002 and 2011, and the current COVID-19 pandemic are all from the same family of coronavirus. This work aims to classify COVID-19, SARS, and MERS chest X-ray (CXR) images using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A unique database was created, so-called QU-COVID-family, consisting of 423 COVID-19, 144 MERS, and 134 SARS CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition system was proposed to identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN classifier. Furthermore, the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to visualize classification output and understand the reasoning behind the decision of deep CNNs. Several Deep Learning classifiers were trained and tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported. Original and preprocessed images were used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks. Two recognition schemes were considered: plain CXR classification and segmented CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3 outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities of 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. In contrast, for segmented CXRs, InceptionV3 outperformed using the original CXR dataset and achieved sensitivities of 96.94%, 79.68%, and 90.26% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. All networks showed high COVID-19 detection sensitivity (>96%) with the segmented lung images. This indicates the unique radiographic signature of COVID-19 cases in the eyes of AI, which is often a challenging task for medical doctors.	898
Detectability of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and rates  of mortality from the novel coronavirus infection in different regions of the  Russian Federation	Edward Goldstein	2020/09/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02962v4	ArXiv	Relevance: Laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection combined with quarantine for contacts of infected individuals affects the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and levels of related mortality. Practices for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary geographically in Russia. For example, in the city of St. Petersburg, where mortality rate for COVID-19 is the highest in the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020, every death for COVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of COVID-19 in the population, while the corresponding number for the whole of Russia is 58.1, suggesting limited detection of mild/moderate cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg. Methods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 results in lower case-fatality ratio (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population). We used data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results: The correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020 is 0.64 (0.50,0.75). For several regions of the Russian Federation, detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively low, while rates of mortality for COVID-19 are relatively high. Conclusions: Detectability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality from COVID-19. To increase detectability, one ought to test all individuals with respiratory symptoms seeking medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to undertake additional measures to increase the volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2. Such measures, in combination with quarantine for infected cases and their close contacts help to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and diminish the related mortality.	899
Robust Weakly Supervised Learning for COVID-19 Recognition Using  Multi-Center CT Images	Qinghao Ye,Yuan Gao,Weiping Ding,Zhangming Niu,Chengjia Wang,Yinghui Jiang,Minhao Wang,Evandro Fei Fang,Wade Menpes-Smith,Jun Xia,Guang Yang	2021/12/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04984v1	ArXiv	The world is currently experiencing an ongoing pandemic of an infectious disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (i.e., COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in assessing the severity of the infection and can also be used to identify those symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. With a surge of the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients, radiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually. Therefore, an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since the manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can cause possible misjudgment. However, due to various technical specifications of CT scanners located in different hospitals, the appearance of CT images can be significantly different leading to the failure of many automated image recognition approaches. The multi-domain shift problem for the multi-center and multi-scanner studies is therefore nontrivial that is also crucial for a dependable recognition and critical for reproducible and objective diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, we proposed a COVID-19 CT scan recognition model namely coronavirus information fusion and diagnosis network (CIFD-Net) that can efficiently handle the multi-domain shift problem via a new robust weakly supervised learning paradigm. Our model can resolve the problem of different appearance in CT scan images reliably and efficiently while attaining higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.	900
A single-cell RNA expression map of coronavirus receptors and associated  factors in developing human embryos	Stacy Colaco,Karisma Chhabria,Domdatt Singh,Anshul Bhide,Neha Singh,Abhishek Singh,Atahar Husein,Anuradha Mishra,Richa Sharma,Nancy Ashary,Deepak Modi	2020/04/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04935v2	ArXiv	To predict if developing human embryos are permissive to coronaviruses, we analyzed publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm for the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP), the Spike protein cleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of host genes involved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst including the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2, TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are co-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the trophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for proteins ESCRT, viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We identified 1985 genes in epiblast and 1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are enriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells; 216 genes of these are common in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Together our results suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive to coronavirus entry by both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms and they also express the genes for proteins involved in viral endocytosis and replication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient management for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.	901
Using altmetrics for detecting impactful research in quasi-zero-day  time-windows: the case of COVID-19	Erik Boetto,Maria Pia Fantini,Aldo Gangemi,Davide Golinelli,Manfredi Greco,Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese,Valentina Presutti,Flavia Rallo	2020/04/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06179v3	ArXiv	On December 31st 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City. The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since January 2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very early stages is challenging. In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case for investigating: (i) which tools and frameworks are mostly used for early scholarly communication; (ii) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify potential impactful research in tight (i.e. quasi-zero-day) time-windows. A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 appeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that represents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. This suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated with aforementioned indicators. Additionally, we define a method that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact indicator.	902
Ontology-based systematic classification and analysis of coronaviruses,  hosts, and host-coronavirus interactions towards deep understanding of  COVID-19	Hong Yu,Li Li,Hsin-hui Huang,Yang Wang,Yingtong Liu,Edison Ong,Anthony Huffman,Tao Zeng,Jingsong Zhang,Pengpai Li,Zhiping Liu,Xiangyan Zhang,Xianwei Ye,Samuel K. Handelman,Gerry Higgins,Gilbert S. Omenn,Brian Athey,Junguk Hur,Luonan Chen,Yongqun He	2020/05/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00639v1	ArXiv	Given the existing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is critical to systematically study the interactions between hosts and coronaviruses including SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov, and SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19). We first created four host-pathogen interaction (HPI)-Outcome postulates, and generated a HPI-Outcome model as the basis for understanding host-coronavirus interactions (HCI) and their relations with the disease outcomes. We hypothesized that ontology can be used as an integrative platform to classify and analyze HCI and disease outcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses, hosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations. Various COVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend HCI mechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations, we collected 35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and applied literature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus infections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation for integrative HCI-outcome understanding. Using known PPIs as baits, we also developed and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new PPIs and identified their pathological targets on multiple organs. Overall, our proposed ontology-based integrative framework combined with computational predictions can be used to support fundamental understanding of the intricate interactions between human patients and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and their association with various disease outcomes.	903
Covid-19 pandemic and the unprecedented mobilisation of scholarly  efforts prompted by a health crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS,  MERS and 2019-nCov literature	Milad Haghani,Michiel C. J. Bliemer	2020/06/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00674v1	ArXiv	During the current century, each major coronavirus outbreak has triggered a quick surge of academic publications on this topic. The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19), however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than 12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day. With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. SARS and MERS. The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies: (i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MRS.	904
A Drone-based Networked System and Methods for Combating Coronavirus  Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic	Adarsh Kumar,Kriti Sharma,Harvinder Singh,Sagar Gupta Naugriya,Sukhpal Singh Gill,Rajkumar Buyya	2020/06/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06943v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It is similar to influenza viruses and raises concerns through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic worldwide. Within eight months (by August 2020), it infected 24.0 million persons worldwide and over 824 thousand have died. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work investigates the drone-based systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and proposes an architecture for handling pandemic situations in different scenarios using real-time and simulation-based scenarios. The proposed architecture uses wearable sensors to record the observations in Body Area Networks (BANs) in a push-pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed architecture is found to be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic areas where either the wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or chances of COVID-19 spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial amount of data in a stipulated period and helps to take appropriate action as and when required. In real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation for COVID-19 operations, it is observed that a large area can be covered for sanitization, thermal image collection, and patient identification within a short period (2 KMs within 10 minutes approx.) through aerial route. In the simulation, the same statistics are observed with an addition of collision-resistant strategies working successfully for indoor and outdoor healthcare operations. Further, open challenges are identified and promising research directions are highlighted.	905
Not even the air of empty spaces is coronavirus free (Two meters is not  a safe distance)	Edilson Crema	2020/06/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08823v1	ArXiv	A key safety measure encouraged by health authorities to avoid the SARS-CoV-2 spreading is the distance of one to two meters between people. This recommended two-meters distance is mainly based on short-distance contagion, when infected drops are expelled during a speech, coughing, or sneezing and directly hit another person. The dangerous form of airway contamination caused by droplets that remain suspended in the air for several hours has been almost ignored. However, the theoretical calculations performed in this work, recent experiments, and the accumulated knowledge in this and other epidemics indicate that, because of the airborne transmission, there is no safe distance to the coronavirus, either indoors or in open places. Recent investigations have confirmed not only the presence of the coronavirus in droplets suspended in the air but that these viruses remain active for several hours. Furthermore, significant indirect evidence of this means of transmission is the great difference in contagion between Brazilian regions in the current outbreak. While the Amazonian states have a contamination rate greater than 20%, in the southern states of the country this rate is less than 1%, despite high temperatures in the Northern region. Notwithstanding the social and economic differences between these regions, it seems that the extremely high humidity of the forest air prolongs the survival of the viruses in the drops in the external environment. Our theoretical calculations explain empirical observations from recent epidemiological studies and strengthen the need to use, not only a mask but also protective glasses throughout the population in the same way that they are mandatory for health professionals. Besides, our calculations show how air conditioning and heating systems can increase contagion. Finally, we suggest measures that could reduce the spread of the pandemic.	906
A Stochastic Compartmental Model for COVID-19	Giorgio Sonnino,Fernando Mora,Pasquale Nardone	2020/12/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01869v1	ArXiv	We propose two stochastic models for the Coronavirus pandemic. The statistical properties of the models, in particular the correlation functions and the probability density function, have duly been computed. Our models, which generalises a model previously proposed and published in a specialised journal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as the crucial role of the hospitals and Health Care Institutes. To accomplish this work we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model (Susceptible => Infectious => Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and the SIS-model integrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdown measures). We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown measures are removed, the Coronavirus will start growing again. However, in the second scenario, beyond a certain threshold of the hospital capacities, the Coronavirus is not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends to diminish in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures with the action of the hospitals and health Institutes is able to contain and dampen the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result can be used during a period of time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited number of vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of example, we analysed the data for USA and France where the intensities of the noise have been estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular, for USA we have analysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject to the first wave of infection by and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The agreement between theoretical predictions and real data confirms the validity of our approach.	907
Detecting the patient's need for help with machine learning	Lauri Lahti	2020/12/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13626v2	ArXiv	"Developing machine learning models to support health analytics requires increased understanding about statistical properties of self-rated expression statements. We analyzed self-rated expression statements concerning the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic to identify statistically significant differences between groups of respondents and to detect the patient's need for help with machine learning. Our quantitative study gathered the ""need for help"" ratings for twenty health-related expression statements concerning the coronavirus epidemic on a 11-point Likert scale, and nine answers about the person's health and wellbeing, sex and age. Online respondents between 30 May and 3 August 2020 were recruited from Finnish patient and disabled people's organizations, other health-related organizations and professionals, and educational institutions (n=673). We analyzed rating differences and dependencies with Kendall rank-correlation and cosine similarity measures and tests of Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between groups, and carried out machine learning experiments with a basic implementation of a convolutional neural network algorithm. We found statistically significant correlations and high cosine similarity values between various health-related expression statement pairs concerning the ""need for help"" ratings and a background question pair. We also identified statistically significant rating differences for several health-related expression statements in respect to groupings based on the answer values of background questions, such as the ratings of suspecting to have the coronavirus infection and having it depending on the estimated health condition, quality of life and sex. Our experiments with a convolutional neural network algorithm showed the applicability of machine learning to support detecting the need for help in the patient's expressions."	908
On the Privacy of National Contact Tracing COVID-19 Applications: The  Coronavírus-SUS Case	Jéferson Campos Nobre,Laura Rodrigues Soares,Briggette Olenka Roman Huaytalla,Elvandi da Silva Júnior,Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville	2021/08/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00921v1	ArXiv	The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by a quick dissemination of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a deep impact worldwide, both in terms of the loss of human life and the economic and social disruption. The use of digital technologies has been seen as an important effort to combat the pandemic and one of such technologies is contact tracing applications. These applications were successfully employed to face other infectious diseases, thus they have been used during the current pandemic. However, the use of contact tracing poses several privacy concerns since it is necessary to store and process data which can lead to the user/device identification as well as location and behavior tracking. These concerns are even more relevant when considering nationwide implementations since they can lead to mass surveillance by authoritarian governments. Despite the restrictions imposed by data protection laws from several countries, there are still doubts on the preservation of the privacy of the users. In this article, we analyze the privacy features in national contact tracing COVID-19 applications considering their intrinsic characteristics. As a case study, we discuss in more depth the Brazilian COVID-19 application Coronav\'irus-SUS, since Brazil is one of the most impacted countries by the current pandemic. Finally, as we believe contact tracing will continue to be employed as part of the strategy for the current and potential future pandemics, we present key research challenges.	909
Sentiment Analysis of Microblogging dataset on Coronavirus Pandemic	Nosin Ibna Mahbub,Md Rakibul Islam,Md Al Amin,Md Khairul Islam,Bikash Chandra Singh,Md Imran Hossain Showrov,Anirudda Sarkar	2021/11/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09275v1	ArXiv	Sentiment analysis can largely influence the people to get the update of the current situation. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a contagious illness caused by the coronavirus 2 that causes severe respiratory symptoms. The lives of millions have continued to be affected by this pandemic, several countries have resorted to a full lockdown. During this lockdown, people have taken social networks to express their emotions to find a way to calm themselves down. People are spreading their sentiments through microblogging websites as one of the most preventive steps of this disease is the socialization to gain people's awareness to stay home and keep their distance when they are outside home. Twitter is a popular online social media platform for exchanging ideas. People can post their different sentiments, which can be used to aware people. But, some people want to spread fake news to frighten the people. So, it is necessary to identify the positive, negative, and neutral thoughts so that the positive opinions can be delivered to the mass people for spreading awareness to the people. Moreover, a huge volume of data is floating on Twitter. So, it is also important to identify the context of the dataset. In this paper, we have analyzed the Twitter dataset for evaluating the sentiment using several machine learning algorithms. Later, we have found out the context learning of the dataset based on the sentiments.	910
Coronavirus and financial volatility: 40 days of fasting and fear	Claudiu Albulescu	2020/03/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04005v1	ArXiv	40 days after the start of the international monitoring of COVID-19, we search for the effect of official announcements regarding new cases of infection and death ratio on the financial markets volatility index (VIX). Whereas the new cases reported in China and outside China have a mixed effect on financial volatility, the death ratio positively influences VIX, that outside China triggering a more important impact. In addition, the higher the number of affected countries, the higher the financial volatility is.	911
Do COVID-19 and crude oil prices drive the US economic policy  uncertainty?	Claudiu Albulescu	2020/03/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07591v1	ArXiv	This paper investigates the effect of the novel coronavirus and crude oil prices on the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Using daily data for the period January 21-March 13, 2020, our Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model shows that the new infection cases reported at global level, and the death ratio, have no significant effect on the US EPU, whereas the oil price negative dynamics leads to increased uncertainty. However, analyzing the situation outside China, we discover that both new case announcements and the COVID-19 associated death ratio have a positive influence on the US EPU.	912
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Dynamics of COVID-19 and Economic  Impact	Alexis Akira Toda	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11221v2	ArXiv	I estimate the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The transmission rate is heterogeneous across countries and far exceeds the recovery rate, which enables a fast spread. In the benchmark model, 28% of the population may be simultaneously infected at the peak, potentially overwhelming the healthcare system. The peak reduces to 6.2% under the optimal mitigation policy that controls the timing and intensity of social distancing. A stylized asset pricing model suggests that the stock price temporarily decreases by 50% in the benchmark case but shows a W-shaped, moderate but longer bear market under the optimal policy.	913
MeSH descriptors indicate the knowledge growth in the  SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic	Johannes Stegmann	2020/05/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06259v1	ArXiv	The scientific papers dealing with the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by this virus, published in 2020 and recorded in the database PUBMED, were retrieved on April 27, 2020. About 20\% of the records contain Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), keywords assigned to records in the course of the indexing process in order to summarise the articles' contents. The temporal sequence of the first occurrences of the keywords was determined, thus giving insight into the growth of the knowledge base of the pandemic.	914
Avoiding COVID-19: Aerosol Guidelines	Matthew Evans	2020/05/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10988v3	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need to understand respiratory virus transmission mechanisms. In preparation for an anticipated influenza pandemic, a substantial body of literature has developed over the last few decades showing that the short-range aerosol route is an important, though often neglected transmission path. We develop a simple mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission via aerosols, apply it to known outbreaks, and present quantitative guidelines for ventilation and occupancy in the workplace.	915
Changing Clusters of Indian States with respect to number of Cases of  COVID-19 using incrementalKMN Method	Rabinder Kumar Prasad,Rosy Sarmah,Subrata Chakraborty	2020/07/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05954v1	ArXiv	The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) incidence in India is currently experiencing exponential rise but with apparent spatial variation in growth rate and doubling time rate. We classify the states into five clusters with low to the high-risk category and study how the different states moved from one cluster to the other since the onset of the first case on $30^{th}$ January 2020 till the end of unlock 1 that is $30^{th}$ June 2020. We have implemented a new clustering technique called the incrementalKMN (Prasad, R. K., Sarmah, R., Chakraborty, S.(2019))	916
A Relationship Between SIR Model and Generalized Logistic Distribution  with Applications to SARS and COVID-19	Hideo Hirose	2020/09/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09653v2	ArXiv	This paper shows that the generalized logistic distribution model is derived from the well-known compartment model, consisting of susceptible, infected and recovered compartments, abbreviated as the SIR model, under certain conditions. In the SIR model, there are uncertainties in predicting the final values for the number of infected population and the infectious parameter. However, by utilizing the information obtained from the generalized logistic distribution model, we can perform the SIR numerical computation more stably and more accurately. Applications to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using this combined method are also introduced.	917
Mathematics Indicates That an HIV-Style Strategy Could Be Applied to  Manage the Coronavirus	Julie Rowlett	2020/12/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01557v1	ArXiv	We have learned to live with many potentially deadly viruses for which there is no vaccine, no immunity, and no cure. We do not live in constant fear of these viruses, instead, we have learned how to outsmart them and reduce the harm they cause. A new mathematical model that combines the spread of diseases that do not confer immunity together with the evolution of human behaviors indicates that we may be able to fight new diseases with the same type of strategy we use to fight viruses like HIV.	918

Greene	2021/03/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02723v3	ArXiv	After emerging in China in late 2019, the novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread worldwide and as of early 2021, continues to significantly impact most countries. Only a small number of coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two are associated with the severe outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, a closely related species of SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. Both of these previous epidemics were controlled fairly rapidly through public health measures, and no vaccines or robust therapeutic interventions were identified. However, previous insights into the immune response to coronaviruses gained during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have proved beneficial to identifying approaches to the treatment and prophylaxis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A number of potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and the resultant COVID-19 illness were rapidly identified, leading to a large number of clinical trials investigating a variety of possible therapeutic approaches being initiated early on in the pandemic. As a result, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and many other therapeutics remain under investigation. Here, we describe a range of approaches for the treatment of COVID-19, along with their proposed mechanisms of action and the current status of clinical investigation into each candidate. The status of these investigations will continue to evolve, and this review will be updated as progress is made.	919

We use early reported case data to predict the cumulative number of reported cases to a final size. The key features of our model are the timing of implementation of major public policies restricting social movement, the identification and isolation of unreported cases, and the impact of asymptomatic infectious cases.	921
Changes in electricity demand pattern in Europe due to COVID-19  shutdowns	Michał Narajewski,Florian Ziel	2020/04/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14864v2	ArXiv	The article covers electricity demand shift effects due to COVID-19 shutdowns in various European countries.

Controlling Propagation of epidemics via mean-field control	Wonjun Lee,Siting Liu,Hamidou Tembine,Wuchen Li,Stanley Osher	2020/06/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01249v2	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing and impacting lives on a global scale. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field game model in controlling the propagation of epidemics on a spatial domain. The control variable, the spatial velocity, is first introduced for the classical disease models, such as the SIR model. For this proposed model, we provide fast numerical algorithms based on proximal primal-dual methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model illustrates how to separate infected patients in a spatial domain effectively.	923
Accounting for Uncertainty During a Pandemic	Jon Zelner,Julien Riou,Ruth Etzioni,Andrew Gelman	2020/06/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08745v1	ArXiv	We discuss several issues of statistical design, data collection, analysis, communication, and decision making that have arisen in recent and ongoing coronavirus studies, focusing on tools for assessment and propagation of uncertainty. This paper does not purport to be a comprehensive survey of the research literature; rather, we use examples to illustrate statistical points that we think are important.	924
Pyroptosis: Physiological roles in viral infection	Nelson Duran,Wagner J. Favaro	2020/06/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15777v1	ArXiv	The current review focuses on important aspects of pyroptosis, such as morphological features of inflammasomes, as well as on knowledge about coronavirus infection mechanisms and the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cell pyroptosis. The application of immunomodulation therapies to Covid-19 patients is the most promising treatment under investigation nowadays. The possibilities of assistance to help protecting patients from infections are also addressed in the present study.	925
So You Need Datasets for Your COVID-19 Detection Research Using Machine  Learning?	Md Fahimuzzman Sohan	2020/08/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05906v2	ArXiv	Millions of people are infected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) around the world. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being used for COVID19 detection research from the beginning of the epidemic. This article represents the detailed information on frequently used datasets in COVID19 detection using Machine Learning (ML). We investigated 96 papers on COVID19 detection between January 2020 and June 2020. We extracted the information about used datasets from the articles and represented them here simultaneously. This investigation will help future researchers to find the COVID19 datasets without difficulty.	926
Synchronized Attachment and the Darwinian Evolution of Coronaviruses  CoV-1 and CoV-2	J. C. Phillips	2020/08/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12168v2	ArXiv	CoV2019 has evolved to be much more dangerous than CoV2003. Experiments suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We identify a new first stage of infection which precedes structural rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally.	927

Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning for Covid-19 and Anderson Insulator  Predictions	Paul-Aymeric McRae,Michael Hilke	2020/12/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03472v1	ArXiv	"Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms to solve classifications problems have been made available thanks to recent advancements in quantum computation. While the number of qubits are still relatively small, they have been used for ""quantum enhancement"" of machine learning. An important question is related to the efficacy of such protocols. We evaluate this efficacy using common baseline data sets, in addition to recent coronavirus spread data as well as the quantum metal-insulator transition in three dimensions. For the computation, we used the 16 qubit IBM quantum computer. We find that the ""quantum enhancement"" is not generic and fails for more complex machine learning tasks."	929
Explainable Link Prediction for Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing	Balaji Ganesan,Hima Patel,Sameep Mehta	2020/12/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05516v1	ArXiv	Contact Tracing has been used to identify people who were in close proximity to those infected with SARS-Cov2 coronavirus. A number of digital contract tracing applications have been introduced to facilitate or complement physical contact tracing. However, there are a number of privacy issues in the implementation of contract tracing applications, which make people reluctant to install or update their infection status on these applications. In this concept paper, we present ideas from Graph Neural Networks and explainability, that could improve trust in these applications, and encourage adoption by people.	930
How Misuse of Statistics Can Spread Misinformation: A Study of  Misrepresentation of COVID-19 Data	Shailesh Bharati,Rahul Batra	2021/02/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07198v1	ArXiv	This paper investigates various ways in which a pandemic such as the novel coronavirus, could be predicted using different mathematical models. It also studies the various ways in which these models could be depicted using various visualization techniques. This paper aims to present various statistical techniques suggested by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in order to represent the epidemiological data. The main focus of this paper is to analyse how epidemiological data or contagious diseases are theorized using any available information and later may be presented wrongly by not following the guidelines, leading to inaccurate representation and interpretations of the current scenario of the pandemic; with a special reference to the Indian Subcontinent.	931
CxSE: Chest X-ray Slow Encoding CNN forCOVID-19 Diagnosis	Thangarajah Akilan	2021/06/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12157v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus continues to disrupt our everyday lives as it spreads at an exponential rate. It needs to be detected quickly in order to quarantine positive patients so as to avoid further spread. This work proposes a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called 'slow Encoding CNN. The proposed model's best performance wrt Sensitivity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) found to be SP=0.67, PP=0.98, SN=0.96, and PN=0.52 on AI AGAINST COVID19 - Screening X-ray images for COVID-19 Infections competition's test data samples. SP and PP stand for the Sensitivity and PPV of the COVID-19 positive class, while PN and SN stand for the Sensitivity and PPV of the COVID-19 negative class.	932
The Role of Nanotechnology to Combat Major Recent Worldwide Challenges	G. Ali Mansoori	2021/07/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00820v2	ArXiv	There are two major challenging problems facing humanity today which are the ongoing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic started in late 2019 and the environmental crisis due to fossil fuels combustion causing over increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. While the first problem seems to be a temporary remedy for the second one due to less travels by individuals, actual solution of both problems may require a comprehensive scientific, technological, and socioeconomic decisions. In this report we look at the role of nanotechnology and nano-scale materials towards the solution of these two major challenges.	933
Unsupervised Text Mining of COVID-19 Records	Mohamad Zamini	2021/09/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07357v1	ArXiv	Since the beginning of coronavirus, the disease has spread worldwide and drastically changed many aspects of the human's lifestyle. Twitter as a powerful tool can help researchers measure public health in response to COVID-19. According to the high volume of data production on social networks, automated text mining approaches can help search, read and summarize helpful information. This paper preprocessed the existing medical dataset regarding COVID-19 named CORD-19 and annotated the dataset for supervised classification tasks. At this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a preprocessed dataset for the research community. This may contribute towards finding new solutions for some social interventions that COVID-19 has made. The preprocessed version of the mentioned dataset is publicly available through Github.	934
COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-ray Images Using Swin-Transformer and  Transformer in Transformer	Juntao Jiang,Shuyi Lin	2021/10/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08427v2	ArXiv	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and caused serious damage. Chest X-ray images are widely used for COVID-19 diagnosis and the Artificial Intelligence method can increase efficiency and accuracy. In the Challenge of Chest XR COVID-19 detection in Ethics and Explainability for Responsible Data Science (EE-RDS) conference 2021, we proposed a method that combined Swin Transformer and Transformer in Transformer to classify chest X-ray images as three classes: COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal (healthy) and achieved 0.9475 accuracies on the test set.	935
A Continuous-Time Markov Chain Model for the Spread of COVID-19	Armine Bagyan,Donald Richards	2022/06/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10179v1	ArXiv	Since late 2019 the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has caused a pandemic that persists. This paper shows how a continuous-time Markov chain model for the spread of COVID-19 can be used to explain, and justify to undergraduate students, strategies now being used in attempts to control the virus. The material in the paper is written at the level of students who are taking an introductory course on the theory and applications of stochastic processes.	936
Diagnosis of COVID-19 disease using CT scan images and pre-trained  models	Faezeh Amouzegar,Hamid Mirvaziri,Mostafa Ghazizadeh-Ahsaee,Mahdi Shariatzadeh	2022/08/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07829v1	ArXiv	Diagnosis of COVID-19 is necessary to prevent and control the disease. Deep learning methods have been considered a fast and accurate method. In this paper, by the parallel combination of three well-known pre-trained networks, we attempted to distinguish coronavirus-infected samples from healthy samples. The negative log-likelihood loss function has been used for model training. CT scan images in the SARS-CoV-2 dataset were used for diagnosis. The SARS-CoV-2 dataset contains 2482 images of lung CT scans, of which 1252 images belong to COVID-19-infected samples. The proposed model was close to 97% accurate.	937
Why and How Did the COVID Pandemic End Abruptly?	J. C. Phillips	2023/10/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02300v1	ArXiv	Phase transition theory, implemented quantitatively by thermodynamic scaling, has explained the evolution of Coronavirus extremely high contagiousness caused by a few key mutations from CoV2003 to CoV2019 identified among hundreds, as well as the later 2021 evolution to Omicron caused by 30 mutations. It also showed that the 2022 strain BA.5 with five mutations began a new path. Here we show that the early 2023 strains BKK with one stiffening mutation confirm that path, and the single flexing mutation of a later 2023 variant EG.5 strengthens it further. The few mutations of the new path have greatly reduced pandemic deaths, for mechanical reasons proposed here.	938
Towards Large-scale Masked Face Recognition	Manyuan Zhang,Bingqi Ma,Guanglu Song,Yunxiao Wang,Hongsheng Li,Yu Liu	2023/10/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16364v1	ArXiv	During the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic, almost everyone is wearing masks, which poses a huge challenge for deep learning-based face recognition algorithms. In this paper, we will present our \textbf{championship} solutions in ICCV MFR WebFace260M and InsightFace unconstrained tracks. We will focus on four challenges in large-scale masked face recognition, i.e., super-large scale training, data noise handling, masked and non-masked face recognition accuracy balancing, and how to design inference-friendly model architecture. We hope that the discussion on these four aspects can guide future research towards more robust masked face recognition systems.	939
Analysing pandemics in phase-space	Olivier Merlo	2024/08/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08036v1	ArXiv	Based on the SIRD-model a new model including time-delay is proposed for a description of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. All data were analysed by representing all quantities as a function of the susceptible population, as opposed to the usual dependence on time. The total number of deaths could be predicted for the first, second and third wave of the pandemic in Germany with an accuracy of about 10\%, shortly after the maximum of infectious people was reached. By using the presentation in phase space, it could be shown that a classical SEIRD- and SIRD-model with constant parameters will not be able to describe the first wave of the pandemic accurately.	940
Assessment of the MERS-CoV epidemic situation in the Middle East region	Chiara Poletto,Camille Pelat,Daniel Levy-Bruhl,Yazdan Yazdanpanah,Pierre-Yves Boelle,Vittoria Colizza	2013/11/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1481v2	ArXiv	The appearance of a novel coronavirus named Middle East (ME) Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has raised global public health concerns regarding the current situation and its future evolution. Here we propose an integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region and importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic (R=0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI 0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security, this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates, suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for increased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.	941
Integration of ontology with machine learning to predict the presence of  covid-19 based on symptoms	Hakim El Massari,Noreddine Gherabi,Sajida Mhammedi,Hamza Ghandi,Fatima Qanouni,Mohamed Bahaj	2012/05/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5923v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus (covid 19) is one of the most dangerous viruses that have spread all over the world. With the increasing number of cases infected with the coronavirus, it has become necessary to address this epidemic by all available means. Detection of the covid-19 is currently one of the world's most difficult challenges. Data science and machine learning (ML), for example, can aid in the battle against this pandemic. Furthermore, various research published in this direction proves that ML techniques can identify illness and viral infections more precisely, allowing patients' diseases to be detected at an earlier stage. In this paper, we will present how ontologies can aid in predicting the presence of covid-19 based on symptoms. The integration of ontology and ML is achieved by implementing rules of the decision tree algorithm into ontology reasoner. In addition, we compared the outcomes with various ML classifications used to make predictions. The findings are assessed using performance measures generated from the confusion matrix, such as F-measure, accuracy, precision, and recall. The ontology surpassed all ML algorithms with high accuracy value of 97.4%, according to the results.	942
Old Drugs for Newly Emerging Viral Disease, COVID-19: Bioinformatic  Prospective	Mohammad Reza Dayer	2020/03/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04524v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in late 2019 and 2020 comprises a serious and more likely a pandemic threat worldwide. Given that the disease has not approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for drug design and or clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1 protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory potency of candidates are as follows Tipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir for HIV-1 protease inhibitors and Cefditoren>Cefixime>Erythromycin>Clarithromycin for anti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for their overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey by clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus infections.	943
Short-term predictions and prevention strategies for COVID-19: A model  based study	Sk Shahid Nadim,Indrajit Ghosh,Joydev Chattopadhyay	2020/03/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08150v3	ArXiv	An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing from December 2019. As of July 22, 2020, it has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 15 million confirmed infections and above 6 hundred thousand reported deaths worldwide. During this period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rising worldwide, investigation of control strategies and forecasting are necessary for health care planning. In this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from the United Kingdom (UK) where the situation is still alarming. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ($R_0>1$, $R_c>1$) is already present. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID-19 cases is well captured by the model. Further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. Thus, if limited resources are available, then investing on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful in terms of reduction of cases.	944
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Classification using CT Images by Machine  Learning Methods	Mucahid Barstugan,Umut Ozkaya,Saban Ozturk	2020/03/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09424v1	ArXiv	This study presents early phase detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is named by World Health Organization (WHO), by machine learning methods. The detection process was implemented on abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) images. The expert radiologists detected from CT images that COVID-19 shows different behaviours from other viral pneumonia. Therefore, the clinical experts specify that COV\.ID-19 virus needs to be diagnosed in early phase. For detection of the COVID-19, four different datasets were formed by taking patches sized as 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 from 150 CT images. The feature extraction process was applied to patches to increase the classification performance. Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Directional Pattern (LDP), Grey Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) algorithms were used as feature extraction methods. Support Vector Machines (SVM) classified the extracted features. 2-fold, 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validations were implemented during the classification process. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score metrics were used to evaluate the classification performance. The best classification accuracy was obtained as 99.68% with 10-fold cross-validation and GLSZM feature extraction method.	945
On a quarantine model of coronavirus infection and data analysis	Vitaly Volpert,Malay Banerjee,Sergei Petrovskii	2020/03/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09444v1	ArXiv	Attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus by introducing strict quarantine measures apparently have different effect in different countries: while the number of new cases has reportedly decreased in China and South Korea, it still exhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across Europe. In this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\mathcal{R}_0 >1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if $\mathcal{R}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.	946
Composite Monte Carlo Decision Making under High Uncertainty of Novel  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction	Simon James Fong,Gloria Li,Nilanjan Dey,Ruben Gonzalez Crespo,Enrique Herrera-Viedma	2020/03/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09868v1	ArXiv	In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019, governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.	947
The modelling of COVID19 pathways sheds light on mechanisms,  opportunities and on controversial interpretations of medical treatments. v2	Maria Luisa Chiusano	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11614v1	ArXiv	The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV2), inducing the current pandemic disease (COVID-19) and causing pneumoniae in humans, is dramatically increasing in epidemic scale since its first appearance in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The first infection from epidemic coronaviruses in 2003 fostered the spread of an overwhelming amount of related scientific efforts. The manifold aspects that have been raised, as well as their redundancy offer precious information that has been underexploited and needs to be critically re-evaluated, appropriately used and offered to the whole community, from scientists, to medical doctors, stakeholders and common people. These efforts will favour a holistic view on the comprehension, prevention and development of strategies (pharmacological, clinical etc) as well as common intervention against the new coronavirus spreading. Here we describe a model that emerged from our analysis that was focused on the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and the possible routes linking it to the viral infection. because the infection is mediated by the viral receptor on human cell membranes Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2), which is a key component in RAS signalling. The model depicts the main pathways determining the disease and the molecular framework for its establishment, and can help to shed light on mechanisms involved in the infection. It promptly gives an answer to some of the controversial, and still open, issues concerning predisposing conditions and medical treatments that protect from or favour the severity of the disease (such as the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs/sartans), or to the sex related biases in the affected population. The model highlights novel opportunities for further investigations, diagnosis and appropriate intervention to understand and fight COVID19.	948
Anonymous Collocation Discovery: Harnessing Privacy to Tame the  Coronavirus	Ran Canetti,Ari Trachtenberg,Mayank Varia	2020/03/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13670v4	ArXiv	Successful containment of the Coronavirus pandemic rests on the ability to quickly and reliably identify those who have been in close proximity to a contagious individual. Existing tools for doing so rely on the collection of exact location information of individuals over lengthy time periods, and combining this information with other personal information. This unprecedented encroachment on individual privacy at national scales has created an outcry and risks rejection of these tools.   We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing fine-grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of an infected individual. Crucially, this is done while preserving the anonymity of all individuals, and without collecting or storing any personal information or location history. Our approach is based on using short-range communication mechanisms, like Bluetooth, that are available in all modern cell phones. It can be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low false-positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a number of extensions and tradeoffs.   We believe that the privacy guarantees provided by the scheme will encourage quick and broad voluntary adoption. When combined with sufficient testing capacity and existing best practices from healthcare professionals, we hope that this may significantly reduce the infection rate.	949
Understanding the COVID19 Outbreak: A Comparative Data Analytics and  Study	Anis Koubaa	2020/03/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14150v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 virus, has emerged in Wuhan China since late November 2019. Since that time, it has been spreading at large-scale until today all around the world. It is currently recognized as the world's most viral and severe epidemic spread in the last twenty years, as compared to Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003. Despite being still in the middle of the outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID-19. The objective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in a short time worldwide in unprecedented fashion. This paper represents a first initiative to achieve this goal, and it provides a comprehensive analytical study about the Coronavirus. The contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive models that give insights into COVID-19 impact through the analysis of extensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries. We aim at answering several open questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world? What is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent, region, and country levels? How does its severity compare with other epidemic outbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a correlation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases? We present a comprehensive analytics visualization to address the questions mentioned above. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic analytical papers that pave the way towards a better understanding of COVID-19. The analytical dashboards and collected data of this study are available online [1].	950
Prediction of repurposed drugs for treating lung injury in COVID-19	Bing He,Lana Garmire	2020/03/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14333v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019 and currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues, including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.	951
Spatiotemporal dynamics in demography-sensitive disease transmission:  COVID-19 spread in NY as a case study	Joydeep Munshi,Indranil Roy,Ganesh Balasubramanian	2020/05/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01001v1	ArXiv	The rapid transmission of the highly contagious novel coronavirus has been represented through several data-guided approaches across targeted geographies, in an attempt to understand when the pandemic will be under control and imposed lockdown measures can be relaxed. However, these epidemiological models predominantly based on training data employing number of cases and fatalities are limited in that they do not account for the spatiotemporal population dynamics that principally contributes to the disease spread. Here, a stochastic cellular automata enabled predictive model is presented that is able to accurate describe the effect of demography-dependent population dynamics on disease transmission. Using the spread of coronavirus in the state of New York as a case study, results from the computational framework remarkably agree with the actual count for infected cases and deaths as reported across organizations. The predictions suggest that an extended lockdown in some form, for up to 180 days, can significantly reduce the risk of a second wave of the outbreak. In addition, increased availability of medical testing is able to reduce the number of infected patients, even when less stringent social distancing guidelines and imposed. Equipping this stochastic approach with demographic factors such as age ratio, pre-existing health conditions, robustifies the model to predict the transmittivity of future outbreaks before they transform into an epidemic.	952
How relevant is the decision of containment measures against COVID-19  applied ahead of time?	Eduardo L. Brugnago,Rafael M. da Silva,Cesar Manchein,Marcus W. Beims	2020/05/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01473v1	ArXiv	The cumulative number of confirmed infected individuals by the new coronavirus outbreak until April 30th, 2020, is presented for the countries: Belgium, Brazil, United Kingdom (UK), and United States of America (USA). After an initial period with a low incidence of newly infected people, a power-law growth of the number of confirmed cases is observed. For each country, a distinct growth exponent is obtained. For Belgium, UK, and USA, countries with a large number of infected people, after the power-law growth a distinct behavior is obtained when approaching saturation. Brazil is still in the power-law regime. Such updates of the data and projections corroborate recent results regarding the power-law growth of the virus and their strong Distance Correlation between some countries around the world. Furthermore, we show that act in time is one of the most relevant non-pharmacological weapons that the health organizations have in the battle against the COVID-19, infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. We study how changing the social distance and the number of daily tests to identify infected asymptomatic individuals can interfere in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 when applied in three distinct days, namely April 16th (early), April 30th (current), and May 14th (late). Results show that containment actions are necessary to flatten the curves and should be applied as soon as possible.	953
Mutations on COVID-19 diagnostic targets	Rui Wang,Yuta Hozumi,Changchuan Yin,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02188v1	ArXiv	Effective, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic reagents are of paramount importance for combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a time there is no preventive vaccine nor specific drug available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It would be an absolute tragedy if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined in any manner. Based on the genotyping of 7818 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected up to May 1, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19 diagnostic targets have had mutations. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most devastating mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) gene primers and probes, which have been unfortunately used by countries around the world to diagnose COVID-19. Our findings explain what has seriously gone wrong with a specific diagnostic reagent made in China. To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation ratio and mutation $h$-index of all SARS-CoV genes, indicating that the N gene is the most non-conservative gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings enable researchers to target the most conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins for the design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.	954
Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with Structured Latent  Multi-View Representation Learning	Hengyuan Kang,Liming Xia,Fuhua Yan,Zhibin Wan,Feng Shi,Huan Yuan,Huiting Jiang,Dijia Wu,He Sui,Changqing Zhang,Dinggang Shen	2020/05/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03227v1	ArXiv	Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Due to the large number of affected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the numbers of training data.	955
Computational modeling of Human-nCoV protein-protein interaction network	Sovan Saha,Anup Kumar Halder,Soumyendu Sekhar Bandyopadhyay,Piyali Chatterjee,Mita Nasipuri,Subhadip Basu	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04108v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 has created a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality in 2020. Novel coronavirus (nCoV), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (89% similarity). Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network, using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions. Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. These proteins are considered as potential human targets for nCoV bait proteins. A gene-ontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at 99.98% specificity threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network is finally validated using 7 potential FDA listed drugs for COVID-19 with significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified spreader proteins.	956
Sustaining the economy under partial lockdown: A pandemic centric  approach	Saket Saurabh,Ayush Trivedi,Nithilaksh P. Lokesh,Bhagyashree Gaikwad	2020/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08273v1	ArXiv	As the world fights to contain and control the spread of the Novel Coronavirus, countries are imposing severe measures from restrictions on travel and social gatherings to complete lockdowns. Lockdowns, though effective in controlling the virus spread, leaves a massive economic impact. In a country like India with 21.9 % of its population below the poverty line, lockdowns have a direct impact on the livelihood of a large part of the population. Our approach conforms to healthcare and state practices of reducing human to human contact, by optimizing the lockdown strategy. We propose resuming economic activities while keeping healthcare facilities from being overwhelmed. We model the coronavirus pandemic as SEIR dynamic model for a set of states as nodes with certain population and analyze the model output before and after complete lockdown. Social distancing that people would willingly follow, in the no lockdown situation is modeled as being influenced with the knowledge of the current number of infection by imitating Granovetter threshold model. We then provide optimal lockdown policy solutions for the duration of ten weeks using NSGA-II optimization algorithm. While there are many studies that focus on modelling the transmission of COVID-19, ours is one of the few attempts to strike a balance between number of infections and economic operations.	957
Clinical Predictive Models for COVID-19: Systematic Study	Patrick Schwab,August DuMont Schütte,Benedikt Dietz,Stefan Bauer	2020/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08302v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%, 51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine which clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.	958
Repurpose Open Data to Discover Therapeutics for COVID-19 using Deep  Learning	Xiangxiang Zeng,Xiang Song,Tengfei Ma,Xiaoqin Pan,Yadi Zhou,Yuan Hou,Zheng Zhang,George Karypis,Feixiong Cheng	2020/05/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10831v1	ArXiv	There have been more than 850,000 confirmed cases and over 48,000 deaths from the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in the United States alone. However, there are currently no proven effective medications against COVID-19. Drug repurposing offers a promising way for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19. This study reports an integrative, network-based deep learning methodology to identify repurposable drugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, genes, pathways, and expressions, from a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Using Amazon AWS computing resources, we identified 41 repurposable drugs (including indomethacin, toremifene and niclosamide) whose therapeutic association with COVID-19 were validated by transcriptomic and proteomic data in SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells and data from ongoing clinical trials. While this study, by no means recommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep learning methodology to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the potential of accelerating therapeutic development for COVID-19.	959
A low-cost, helmet-based, non-invasive ventilator for COVID-19	Yasser Khan,Hossain Mohammad Fahad,Sifat Muin,Karthik Gopalan	2020/05/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11008v1	ArXiv	"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented need for breathing assistance devices. Since the demand for commercial, full-featured ventilators is far higher than the supply capacity, many rapid-response ventilators are being developed for invasive mechanical ventilation of patients. Most of these emergency ventilators utilize mechanical squeezing of bag-valve-masks or Ambu-bags. These ""bag squeezer"" designs are bulky and heavy, depends on many moving parts, and difficulty to assemble and use. Also, invasive ventilation requires intensive care unit support, which may be unavailable to a vast majority of patients, especially in developing countries. In this work, we present a low-cost ($<$\$200), portable (fits in an 8""x8""x4"" box), non-invasive ventilator (NIV), designed to provide relief to early-stage COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings. We used a high-pressure blower fan for providing noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Our design supports continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) modes. A common concern of using CPAP or BiPAP for treating COVID-19 patients is the aerosolization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used a helmet-based solution that contains the spread of the virus. Our end-to-end solution is compact, low-cost ($<$\$400 including the helmet, viral filters, and a valve), and easy-to-use. Our NIV provides 0-20 cmH$_{2}$O pressure with flow rates of 60-180 Lmin$^{-1}$. We hope that our report will encourage implementations and further studies on helmet-based NIV for treating COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings."	960
Drug repurposing prediction for COVID-19 using probabilistic networks  and crowdsourced curation	David J. Skelton,Aoesha Alsobhe,Elisa Anastasi,Christian Atallah,Jasmine E. Bird,Bradley Brown,Dwayne Didon,Phoenix Gater,Katherine James,David D. Lennon Jr,James McLaughlin,Pollyanna E. J. Moreland,Matthew Pocock,Caroline J. Whitaker,Anil Wipat	2020/05/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11088v2	ArXiv	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, represents an unprecedented global health challenge. Consequently, a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame. However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. In this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs, identifying drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. We demonstrate the value of this approach, reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified, and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies.	961
Unveiling the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibition  from 92 crystal structures	Duc D Nguyen,Kaifu Gao,Jiahui Chen,Rui Wang,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/05/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13653v1	ArXiv	Currently, there is no effective antiviral drugs nor vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity ranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitor complexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) to provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2 M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in M$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$) being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present binding affinity ranking, interaction analysis, and fragment decomposition offer a foundation for future drug discovery efforts.	962
Mutations strengthened SARS-CoV-2 infectivity	Jiahui Chen,Rui Wang,Menglun Wang,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/05/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14669v1	ArXiv	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a major concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic reopening. However, rigorous determination of SARS-COV-2 infectivity is essentially impossible owing to its continuous evolution with over 13752 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in six different subtypes. We develop an advanced machine learning algorithm based on the algebraic topology to quantitatively evaluate the binding affinity changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor following the mutations. Based on mutation-induced binding affinity changes, we reveal that five out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become either moderately or slightly more infectious, while one subtype has weakened its infectivity. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-ACE2 binding affinity changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding affinity calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif (RBM), i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have very high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.	963
Feline coronaviruses associated with feline infectious peritonitis have  modifications to spike protein activation sites at two discrete positions	Beth N. Licitra,Kelly L. Sams,Donald W. Lee,Gary R. Whittaker	2014/12/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4034v1	ArXiv	Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is associated with mutations in the feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike (S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2 are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites. These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.	964
Preliminary prediction of the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan  novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV	Tao Zhou,Quanhui Liu,Zimo Yang,Jingyi Liao,Kexin Yang,Wei Bai,Xin Lü,Wei Zhang	2020/01/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10530v2	ArXiv	Objectives.--To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Methods.--Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before January 25, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results The basic reproduction number falls between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China, and falls between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from colleagues. Conclusions.--The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is closed to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions. Notes Added.--Using a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0].	965
Decoding asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and transmission	Rui Wang,Yuta Hozumi,Changchuan Yin,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/07/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01344v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a continuously devastating public health and the world economy. One of the major challenges in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission, which are elusive and defenseless in most situations. The pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. Based on the genotyping of 20656 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome isolates, we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T mutation, i.e., leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F) substitution at the residue 37 (L37F) of nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6). By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity. Sequence alignment found both NSP6 and residue 37 neighborhoods are relatively conservative over a few coronaviral species, indicating their importance in regulating host cell autophagy to undermine innate cellular defense against viral infection. Using machine learning and topological data analysis, we demonstrate that mutation L37F has made NSP6 energetically less stable. The rigidity and flexibility index and several network models suggest that mutation L37F may have compromised the NSP6 function, leading to a relatively weak SARS-CoV subtype. This assessment is a good agreement with our genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months.	966
A Physics Modeling Study of SARS-CoV-2 Transport in Air	Luis A. Anchordoqui,James B. Dent,Thomas J. Weiler	2020/07/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05410v3	ArXiv	The health threat from SARS-CoV-2 airborne infection has become a public emergency of international concern. During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to maintain social distancing of at least 2 m to limit the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Experimental data, however, show that infected aerosols and droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel up to 7 to 8 m. We propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and its payload of pathogen-virions. We show that the cloud stopping range is proportional to the product of the puff's diameter and its density. We use our puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields $1.8 < \rho_P/\rho_{\rm air} < 4.0$, where $\rho_P$ and $\rho_{\rm air}$ are the average density of the puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an ${\cal O}(\pm 8\%)$ effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold or warmth. We also demonstrate that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows down sufficiently, and its coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.	967
Understanding the temporal evolution of COVID-19 research through  machine learning and natural language processing	Ashkan Ebadi,Pengcheng Xi,Stéphane Tremblay,Bruce Spencer,Raman Pall,Alexander Wong	2020/07/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11604v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been continuously affecting human lives and communities around the world in many ways, from cities under lockdown to new social experiences. Although in most cases COVID-19 results in mild illness, it has drawn global attention due to the extremely contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2. Governments and healthcare professionals, along with people and society as a whole, have taken any measures to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. In this study, we used multiple data sources, i.e., PubMed and ArXiv, and built several machine learning models to characterize the landscape of current COVID-19 research by identifying the latent topics and analyzing the temporal evolution of the extracted research themes, publications similarity, and sentiments, within the time-frame of January- May 2020. Our findings confirm the types of research available in PubMed and ArXiv differ significantly, with the former exhibiting greater diversity in terms of COVID-19 related issues and the latter focusing more on intelligent systems/tools to predict/diagnose COVID-19. The special attention of the research community to the high-risk groups and people with complications was also confirmed.	968
Duality between Coronavirus Transmission and Air-based Macroscopic  Molecular Communication	Max Schurwanz,Peter Adam Hoeher,Sunasheer Bhattacharjee,Martin Damrath,Lukas Stratmann,Falko Dressler	2020/09/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04966v3	ArXiv	This contribution exploits the duality between a viral infection process and macroscopic air-based molecular communication. Airborne aerosol and droplet transmission through human respiratory processes is modeled as an instance of a multiuser molecular communication scenario employing respiratory-event-driven molecular variable-concentration shift keying. Modeling is aided by experiments that are motivated by a macroscopic air-based molecular communication testbed. In artificially induced coughs, a saturated aqueous solution containing a fluorescent dye mixed with saliva is released by an adult test person. The emitted particles are made visible by means of optical detection exploiting the fluorescent dye. The number of particles recorded is significantly higher in test series without mouth and nose protection than in those with a wellfitting medical mask. A simulation tool for macroscopic molecular communication processes is extended and used for estimating the transmission of infectious aerosols in different environments. Towards this goal, parameters obtained through self experiments are taken. The work is inspired by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.	969
Are mouse and cat the missing link in the COVID-19 outbreaks in seafood  markets?	Daniel H. Tao,Weitao Sun	2020/09/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09911v1	ArXiv	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus caused the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) affecting the whole world. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 are thought to originate in bats and then spread to humans through intermediate hosts. Identifying intermediate host species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms of COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains a key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that reflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial mutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different species, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human and monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the highest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values. In terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and human. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live poultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection in these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether mouse and cat are true intermediate hosts. These findings suggest that animals closely related to human life, especially those with high HGS, need to be closely monitored.	970
COVID-19 Pandemic Prediction using Time Series Forecasting Models	Naresh Kumar,Seba Susan	2020/07/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12176v1	ArXiv	Millions of people have been infected and lakhs of people have lost their lives due to the worldwide ongoing novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It is of utmost importance to identify the future infected cases and the virus spread rate for advance preparation in the healthcare services to avoid deaths. Accurately forecasting the spread of COVID-19 is an analytical and challenging real-world problem to the research community. Therefore, we use day level information of COVID-19 spread for cumulative cases from whole world and 10 mostly affected countries; US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, Iran, United Kingdom, Turkey, and India. We utilize the temporal data of coronavirus spread from January 22, 2020 to May 20, 2020. We model the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, and perform prediction using ARIMA and Prophet time series forecasting models. Effectiveness of the models are evaluated based on the mean absolute error, root mean square error, root relative squared error, and mean absolute percentage error. Our analysis can help in understanding the trends of the disease outbreak, and provide epidemiological stage information of adopted countries. Our investigations show that ARIMA model is more effective for forecasting COVID-19 prevalence. The forecasting results have potential to assist governments to plan policies to contain the spread of the virus.	971
Insights into the Impact of COVID-19 on Bicycle Usage in Colorado  Counties	Abdullah Kurkcu,Ilgin Gokasar,Onur Kalan,Alperen Timurogullari,Burak Altin	2021/01/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10130v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus, which emerged in China towards the end of 2019 and subsequently influenced the whole world, has changed the daily lives of people to a great extent. In many parts of the world, in both cities and rural areas, people have been forced to stay home weeks. They have only been allowed to leave home for fundamental needs such as food and health needs, and most started to work from home. In this period, very few people, including essential workers, had to leave their homes. Avoiding social contact is proven to be the best method to reduce the spread of the novel Coronavirus. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, people are adapting their behavior to this new reality, and it may change the type of public events people perform and how people go to these activities. Consumer behaviors have been altered during the pandemic. While people try to avoid gatherings, they also stayed away from mass transport modes and turned to private modes of transportation more -- private cars, private taxis and bike-sharing systems; even walking became more popular. In this study, we attempt to analyze how the use of bicycling has changed -- pre- and post-pandemic -- using open data sources and investigating how socio-economics characteristics affect this change. The results showed that average income, average education level, and total population are the most crucial variables for the Pandemic to Transition period and the Transition to the Normalization period.	972
Hydrophobic interaction determines docking affinity of SARS CoV 2  variants with antibodies	Jiacheng Li,Chengyu Hou,Menghao Wang,Chencheng Liao,Shuai Guo,Liping Shi,Xiaoliang Ma,Hongchi Zhang,Shenda Jiang,Bing Zheng,Lin Ye,Lin Yang,Xiaodong He	2021/02/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00399v1	ArXiv	"Preliminary epidemiologic, phylogenetic and clinical findings suggest that several novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have increased transmissibility and decreased efficacy of several existing vaccines. Four mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that are reported to contribute to increased transmission. Understanding physical mechanism responsible for the affinity enhancement between the SARS-CoV-2 variants and ACE2 is the ""urgent challenge"" for developing blockers, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Based on a hydrophobic-interaction-based protein docking mechanism, this study reveals that the mutation N501Y obviously increased the hydrophobic attraction and decrease hydrophilic repulsion between the RBD and ACE2 that most likely caused the transmissibility increment of the variants. By analyzing the mutation-induced hydrophobic surface changes in the attraction and repulsion at the binding site of the complexes of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and antibodies, we found out that all the mutations of N501Y, E484K, K417N and L452R can selectively decrease or increase their binding affinity with some antibodies."	973
CovidGAN: Data Augmentation Using Auxiliary Classifier GAN for Improved  Covid-19 Detection	Abdul Waheed,Muskan Goyal,Deepak Gupta,Ashish Khanna,Fadi Al-Turjman,Placido Rogerio Pinheiro	2021/03/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05094v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN, the accuracy increased to 95%. We hope this method will speed up COVID-19 detection and lead to more robust systems of radiology.	974
Exploring motivation and teamwork in a large software engineering  capstone course during the coronavirus pandemic	Yngve Lindsjørn,Steffen Almås,Viktoria Stray	2021/03/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08020v1	ArXiv	In the spring of 2020, the Department of Informatics covered a 20 ECTS capstone course in Software Engineering, mainly focusing on developing a complex application. The course used active learning methods, and 240 students were working in 42 cross-functional, agile teams. The pandemic caused by the coronavirus had a significant impact on the teaching given by the University of Oslo, as all physical education and collaboration among the teams had to be digital from March 12. At the end of the semester, we conducted a survey that focused on 1) aspects of teamwork (e.g., communication and coordination in the teams) and the relation to team performance (e.g., the application product) and 2), the students' motivation and ability to cooperate through digital platforms. A total of 151 respondents in 41 agile student teams answered the survey. This study aimed to investigate how the teamwork and motivation of the students were affected by having to work virtually. The results are compared to results from the same course in 2019 and a similar survey on 71 professional teams published in 2016. Our results show that the teamwork was evaluated similarly to both the evaluation of survey conducted in 2019 and on the professional teams in 2016. The motivation among the students remained high, even though they had to collaborate virtually.	975
DCcov: Repositioning of Drugs and Drug Combinations for SARS-CoV-2  Infected Lung through Constraint-Based Modelling	Ali Kishk,Maria Pires Pacheco,Thomas Sauter	2021/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13844v1	ArXiv	The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic with currently no effective antiviral drug except treatments for symptomatic therapy. Flux balance analysis is an efficient method to analyze metabolic networks. It allows optimizing for a metabolic function and thus e.g., predicting the growth rate of a specific cell or the production rate of a metabolite of interest. Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism, and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov). Among the 45 drug candidates, six antiviral drugs were found and seven drugs that are being tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Other drugs like gemcitabine, rosuvastatin and acetylcysteine, and drug combinations like azathioprine-pemetrexed might offer new chances for treating COVID-19.	976
The state of health of the Russian population during the pandemic  (according to sample surveys)	Leysan Anvarovna Davletshina,Natalia Alekseevna Sadovnikova,Alexander Valeryevich Bezrukov,Olga Guryevna Lebedinskaya	2021/09/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05917v1	ArXiv	The article analyzes the population's assessment of their own health and attitude to a healthy lifestyle in the context of distribution by age groups. Of particular interest is the presence of transformations taking into account the complex epidemiological situation, the increase in the incidence of coronavirus infection in the population (the peak of the incidence came during the period of selective observation in 2020). The article assesses the closeness of the relationship between the respondents ' belonging to a particular socio-demographic group and their social well-being during the period of self-isolation, quarantine or other restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. To solve this problem, the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of respondents are presented, the distribution of responses according to the survey results is estimated and the most significant factor characteristics are selected. The distributions of respondents ' responses are presented for the selected questions. To determine the closeness of the relationship between the respondents ' answers to the question and their gender or age distribution, the coefficients of mutual conjugacy and rank correlation coefficients were calculated and analyzed. The ultimate goal of the analytical component of this study is to determine the social well-being of the Russian population during the pandemic on the basis of sample survey data. As a result of the analysis of changes for the period 2019-2020, the assessment of the closeness of communication revealed the parameters that form differences (gender, wealth, territory of residence).	977
An Explainable-AI approach for Diagnosis of COVID-19 using MALDI-ToF  Mass Spectrometry	Venkata Devesh Reddy Seethi,Zane LaCasse,Prajkta Chivte,Joshua Bland,Shrihari S. Kadkol,Elizabeth R. Gaillard,Pratool Bharti,Hamed Alhoori	2021/09/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14099v3	ArXiv	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic and immensely affected the global economy. Accurate, cost-effective, and quick tests have proven substantial in identifying infected people and mitigating the spread. Recently, multiple alternative platforms for testing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been published that show high agreement with current gold standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. These new methods do away with nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, eliminate the need for complicated reagents, and reduce the burden on RT-PCR test reagent supply. In the present work, we have designed an artificial intelligence-based (AI) testing method to provide confidence in the results. Current AI applications for COVID-19 studies often lack a biological foundation in the decision-making process, and our AI approach is one of the earliest to leverage explainable AI (X-AI) algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis using mass spectrometry. Here, we have employed X-AI to explain the decision-making process on a local (per-sample) and global (all samples) basis underscored by biologically relevant features. We evaluated our technique with data extracted from human gargle samples and achieved a testing accuracy of 94.12%. Such techniques would strengthen the relationship between AI and clinical diagnostics by providing biomedical researchers and healthcare workers with trustworthy and, most importantly, explainable test results	978
Dynamic Systems Framework for Modeling COVID-19 with Lévy Noise	Daniel Tesfay,Almaz Tesfay,James Brannan	2021/12/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14876v3	ArXiv	Natural fluctuations have played a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of pervasive diseases such as the coronavirus. Examining the effects of irregular unsettling disturbances on epidemic models is important for understanding these dynamics. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model for the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) dynamics of the coronavirus, incorporating perturbations in the contact rate through Levy noise. The utilization of the Levy process is essential for the protection and control of diseases. We delve into the dynamics of both the deterministic model and the global positive solution of the stochastic model, establishing their existence and uniqueness. Additionally, we explore conditions for the termination and persistence of the infection. Furthermore, we derive the basic reproduction number, a critical determinant of disease extinction or persistence. Numerical results indicate that COVID-19 dissipates from the population when the reproduction number is less than one in the presence of significant or minor noise. Conversely, controlling epidemic diseases becomes challenging when the reproduction number exceeds one. To illustrate this phenomenon, we provide numerical simulations, offering insights into the dynamics of the disease and the efficacy of control measures	979
A Survey on Masked Facial Detection Methods and Datasets for Fighting  Against COVID-19	Bingshu Wang,Jiangbin Zheng,C. L. Philip Chen	2022/01/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04777v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a great challenge to the world since its outbreak. To fight against the disease, a series of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are developed and applied to real-world scenarios such as safety monitoring, disease diagnosis, infection risk assessment, lesion segmentation of COVID-19 CT scans,etc. The coronavirus epidemics have forced people wear masks to counteract the transmission of virus, which also brings difficulties to monitor large groups of people wearing masks. In this paper, we primarily focus on the AI techniques of masked facial detection and related datasets. We survey the recent advances, beginning with the descriptions of masked facial detection datasets. Thirteen available datasets are described and discussed in details. Then, the methods are roughly categorized into two classes: conventional methods and neural network-based methods. Conventional methods are usually trained by boosting algorithms with hand-crafted features, which accounts for a small proportion. Neural network-based methods are further classified as three parts according to the number of processing stages. Representative algorithms are described in detail, coupled with some typical techniques that are described briefly. Finally, we summarize the recent benchmarking results, give the discussions on the limitations of datasets and methods, and expand future research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first survey about masked facial detection methods and datasets. Hopefully our survey could provide some help to fight against epidemics.	980
A Deep Learning Approach for the Detection of COVID-19 from Chest X-Ray  Images using Convolutional Neural Networks	Aditya Saxena,Shamsheer Pal Singh	2022/01/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09952v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 (coronavirus) is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in mid-December 2019 in the Hubei province of Wuhan, China and by now has spread throughout the planet with more than 75.5 million confirmed cases and more than 1.67 million deaths. With limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in medical facilities, it is important to develop and implement an automatic detection system as an alternative diagnosis option for COVID-19 detection that can used on a commercial scale. Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Computer vision and deep learning techniques can help in determining COVID-19 virus with Chest X-ray Images. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural network for image analysis and classification. In this research, we have proposed a deep convolutional neural network trained on five open access datasets with binary output: Normal and Covid. The performance of the model is compared with four pre-trained convolutional neural network-based models (COVID-Net, ResNet18, ResNet and MobileNet-V2) and it has been seen that the proposed model provides better accuracy on the validation set as compared to the other four pre-trained models. This research work provides promising results which can be further improvise and implement on a commercial scale.	981
Simulating the Spread of Epidemics in China on the Multi-layer  Transportation Network: Beyond the Coronavirus in Wuhan	Tianyi Li	2020/02/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12280v1	ArXiv	Based on the SEIR model and the modeling of urban transportation networks, a general-purpose simulator for the spread of epidemics in Chinese cities is built. The Chinese public transportation system between over 340 prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities, peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be used to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective government interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. The model is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that the framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public city-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.	982
Deep Learning on Chest X-ray Images to Detect and Evaluate Pneumonia  Cases at the Era of COVID-19	Karim Hammoudi,Halim Benhabiles,Mahmoud Melkemi,Fadi Dornaika,Ignacio Arganda-Carreras,Dominique Collard,Arnaud Scherpereel	2020/04/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03399v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first symptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets, deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.	983
Harmony-Search and Otsu based System for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)  Detection using Lung CT Scan Images	V. Rajinikanth,Nilanjan Dey,Alex Noel Joseph Raj,Aboul Ella Hassanien,K. C. Santosh,N. Sri Madhava Raja	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03431v1	ArXiv	Pneumonia is one of the foremost lung diseases and untreated pneumonia will lead to serious threats for all age groups. The proposed work aims to extract and evaluate the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused pneumonia infection in lung using CT scans. We propose an image-assisted system to extract COVID-19 infected sections from lung CT scans (coronal view). It includes following steps: (i) Threshold filter to extract the lung region by eliminating possible artifacts; (ii) Image enhancement using Harmony-Search-Optimization and Otsu thresholding; (iii) Image segmentation to extract infected region(s); and (iv) Region-of-interest (ROI) extraction (features) from binary image to compute level of severity. The features that are extracted from ROI are then employed to identify the pixel ratio between the lung and infection sections to identify infection level of severity. The primary objective of the tool is to assist the pulmonologist not only to detect but also to help plan treatment process. As a consequence, for mass screening processing, it will help prevent diagnostic burden.	984
COVID-19 Blockchain Framework: Innovative Approach	Mohamed Torky,Aboul Ella Hassanien	2020/04/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06081v1	ArXiv	The world is currently witnessing dangerous shifts in the epidemic of emerging SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of (COVID-19) coronavirus. The infection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion. This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System. This four components work together for detecting the unknown infected cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona Virus (COVID-19).	985
Sense and Sensibility: Characterizing Social Media Users Regarding the  Use of Controversial Terms for COVID-19	Hanjia Lyu,Long Chen,Yu Wang,Jiebo Luo	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06307v3	ArXiv	"With the world-wide development of 2019 novel coronavirus, although WHO has officially announced the disease as COVID-19, one controversial term - ""Chinese Virus"" is still being used by a great number of people. In the meantime, global online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily, most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media platforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two ways: using controversial terms like ""Chinese Virus"" or ""Wuhan Virus"", or using non-controversial terms like ""Coronavirus"". In this study, we attempt to characterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use non-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related tweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences between these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level features like the number of followers, political following status, as well as their geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict Twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to characterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a major crisis."	986
BETS: The dangers of selection bias in early analyses of the coronavirus  disease (COVID-19) pandemic	Qingyuan Zhao,Nianqiao Ju,Sergio Bacallado,Rajen D. Shah	2020/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07743v4	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly grown from a regional outbreak in Wuhan, China to a global pandemic. Early estimates of the epidemic growth and incubation period of COVID-19 may have been biased due to sample selection. Using detailed case reports from 14 locations in and outside mainland China, we obtained 378 Wuhan-exported cases who left Wuhan before an abrupt travel quarantine. We developed a generative model we call BETS for four key epidemiological events---Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS)---and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were severely biased. All our analyses, regardless of which subsample and model were being used, point to an epidemic doubling time of 2 to 2.5 days during the early outbreak in Wuhan. A Bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests that about 5% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days of infection and that men may be much more likely than women to develop symptoms within 2 days of infection.	987
Iteratively Pruned Deep Learning Ensembles for COVID-19 Detection in  Chest X-rays	Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman,Jen Siegelman,Philip O. Alderson,Lucas S. Folio,Les R. Folio,Sameer K. Antani	2020/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08379v3	ArXiv	We demonstrate use of iteratively pruned deep learning model ensembles for detecting pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 with chest X-rays. This disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19 screening using chest radiographs.	988
Real-time forecasts and risk assessment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)  cases: A data-driven analysis	Tanujit Chakraborty,Indrajit Ghosh	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09996v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the globe. As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.	989

One promising approach is to train machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to screen large numbers of small molecules. As a contribution to that effort, we are aggregating numerous small molecules from a variety of sources, using high-performance computing (HPC) to computer diverse properties of those molecules, using the computed properties to train ML/AI models, and then using the resulting models for screening. In this first data release, we make available 23 datasets collected from community sources representing over 4.2 B molecules enriched with pre-computed: 1) molecular fingerprints to aid similarity searches, 2) 2D images of molecules to enable exploration and application of image-based deep learning methods, and 3) 2D and 3D molecular descriptors to speed development of machine learning models. This data release encompasses structural information on the 4.2 B molecules and 60 TB of pre-computed data. Future releases will expand the data to include more detailed molecular simulations, computed models, and other products.	990
COVID-19 Screening Using Residual Attention Network an Artificial  Intelligence Approach	Vishal Sharma,Curtis Dyreson	2020/06/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16106v3	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus transmits rapidly; it has a basic reproductive number R of 2.2-2.7. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 is currently affecting more than 200 countries with 6M active cases. An effective testing strategy for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak but the demand for testing surpasses the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to screen for COVID-19 using artificial intelligence. Our technique takes only seconds to screen for the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a dataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution neural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet, InceptionResNet) to classify the chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models, we then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to screen COVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 100%. A feature maps visual of our model show areas in a chest X-ray which are important for classification. Our work can help to increase the adaptation of AI-assisted applications in clinical practice. The code and dataset used in this project are available at https://github.com/vishalshar/covid-19-screening-using-RAN-on-X-ray-images.	991
Modeling and Simulation of the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  in Lebanon	Ayman Mourad,Fatima Mroue	2020/08/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03264v1	ArXiv	In this paper, we develop a probabilistic mathematical model for the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease such as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different social and infectiousness conditions of infected people. In particular, it considers the social structure and governmental measures in a country, the fraction of detected cases over the real total infected cases, and the influx of undetected infected people from outside the borders. Although the model is simple and allows a reasonable identification of its parameters, using the data provided by local authorities on this pandemic, it is also complex enough to capture the most important effects. We study the particular case of Lebanon and use its reported data to estimate the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also simulate several scenarios that help policy makers in deciding how to loosen different measures without risking a severe wave of COVID-19. We are also able to identify the main factors that lead to specific scenarios which helps in a better understanding of the spread of the virus.	992
A single-cell mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 induced pyroptosis and  the effects of anti-inflammatory intervention	Sara J Hamis,Fiona R Macfarlane	2020/08/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04172v4	ArXiv	Pyroptosis is an inflammatory mode of cell death that can contribute to the cytokine storm associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is central to pyroptosis, which may be induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be inhibited by certain anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we present a single-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and responses to anti-inflammatory intervention that hinder the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The model is formulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the dynamics of the biological components involved in pyroptosis. Our results demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can delay the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from inflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory e.g., apoptosis). The single-cell model is being implemented in a SARS-CoV-2 Tissue Simulator, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary coalition investigating within host-dynamics of COVID-19. In this paper, we provide an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 Tissue Simulator and highlight the effects of pyroptosis on a cellular level.	993

Milon Islam,Fakhri Karray,Reda Alhajj,Jia Zeng	2020/08/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04815v1	ArXiv	Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, has raised a calamitous situation all over the world and has become one of the most acute and severe ailments in the past hundred years. The prevalence rate of COVID-19 is rapidly rising every day throughout the globe. Although no vaccines for this pandemic have been discovered yet, deep learning techniques proved themselves to be a powerful tool in the arsenal used by clinicians for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. This paper aims to overview the recently developed systems based on deep learning techniques using different medical imaging modalities like Computer Tomography (CT) and X-ray. This review specifically discusses the systems developed for COVID-19 diagnosis using deep learning techniques and provides insights on well-known data sets used to train these networks. It also highlights the data partitioning techniques and various performance measures developed by researchers in this field. A taxonomy is drawn to categorize the recent works for proper insight. Finally, we conclude by addressing the challenges associated with the use of deep learning methods for COVID-19 detection and probable future trends in this research area. This paper is intended to provide experts (medical or otherwise) and technicians with new insights into the ways deep learning techniques are used in this regard and how they potentially further works in combatting the outbreak of COVID-19.	994
A Study on The Effectiveness of Lock-down Measures to Control The Spread  of COVID-19	Subhas Kumar Ghosh,Sachchit Ghosh,Sai Shanmukha Narumanchi	2020/08/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05876v1	ArXiv	The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019-2020 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pathogenic virus is able to spread asymptotically during its incubation stage through a vulnerable population. Given the state of healthcare, policymakers were urged to contain the spread of infection, minimize stress on the health systems and ensure public safety. Most effective tool that was at their disposal was to close non-essential business and issue a stay home order. In this paper we consider techniques to measure the effectiveness of stringency measures adopted by governments across the world. Analyzing effectiveness of control measures like lock-down allows us to understand whether the decisions made were optimal and resulted in a reduction of burden on the healthcare system. In specific we consider using a synthetic control to construct alternative scenarios and understand what would have been the effect on health if less stringent measures were adopted. We present analysis for The State of New York, United States, Italy and The Indian capital city Delhi and show how lock-down measures has helped and what the counterfactual scenarios would have been in comparison to the current state of affairs. We show that in The State of New York the number of deaths could have been 6 times higher, and in Italy, the number of deaths could have been 3 times higher by 26th of June, 2020.	995
Host immune response driving SARS-CoV-2 evolution	Rui Wang,Yuta Hozumi,Yong-Hui Zheng,Changchuan Yin,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/08/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07488v2	ArXiv	The transmission and evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of paramount importance to the controlling and combating of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, near 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, having a great ramification to the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies, and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of getting sick from COVID-19 caused by systemic health and social inequities. Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same origin, their evolution order may be determined from the ratio of mutation type C$>$T over T$>$C.	996
COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in the Subcontinent: A data-driven analysis	Bikash Chandra Singh,Zulfikar Alom,Mohammad Muntasir Rahman,Mrinal Kanti Baowaly,Mohammad Abdul Azim	2020/08/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09803v1	ArXiv	Human civilization is experiencing a critical situation that presents itself for a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society. Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies. Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2 (approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the subcontinent.	997
A comparison of deep machine learning algorithms in COVID-19 disease  diagnosis	Samir S. Yadav,Jasminder Kaur Sandhu,Mininath R. Bendre,Pratap S. Vikhe,Amandeep Kaur	2020/08/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11639v2	ArXiv	The aim of the work is to use deep neural network models for solving the problem of image recognition. These days, every human being is threatened by a harmful coronavirus disease, also called COVID-19 disease. The spread of coronavirus affects the economy of many countries in the world. To find COVID-19 patients early is very essential to avoid the spread and harm to society. Pathological tests and Chromatography(CT) scans are helpful for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, these tests are having drawbacks such as a large number of false positives, and cost of these tests are so expensive. Hence, it requires finding an easy, accurate, and less expensive way for the detection of the harmful COVID-19 disease. Chest-x-ray can be useful for the detection of this disease. Therefore, in this work chest, x-ray images are used for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients using modern machine learning techniques. The analysis of the results is carried out and conclusions are made about the effectiveness of deep machine learning algorithms in image recognition problems.	998
A trial emulation approach for policy evaluations with group-level  longitudinal data	Eli Ben-Michael,Avi Feller,Elizabeth A. Stuart	2020/11/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05826v1	ArXiv	"To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home orders, and numerous studies aim to estimate their effects. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. While these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. ""Target trial emulation"" emphasizes the need to carefully design a non-experimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement -- and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design, which we refer to as ""policy trial emulation."" This is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each ""treatment cohort"" (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods -- with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics -- can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging."	999
A Tiny CNN Architecture for Medical Face Mask Detection for  Resource-Constrained Endpoints	Puranjay Mohan,Aditya Jyoti Paul,Abhay Chirania	2020/11/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14858v3	ArXiv	The world is going through one of the most dangerous pandemics of all time with the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). According to the World Health Organisation, the most effective way to thwart the transmission of coronavirus is to wear medical face masks. Monitoring the use of face masks in public places has been a challenge because manual monitoring could be unsafe. This paper proposes an architecture for detecting medical face masks for deployment on resource-constrained endpoints having extremely low memory footprints. A small development board with an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller clocked at 480 Mhz and having just 496 KB of framebuffer RAM, has been used for the deployment of the model. Using the TensorFlow Lite framework, the model is quantized to further reduce its size. The proposed model is 138 KB post quantization and runs at the inference speed of 30 FPS.	1000
Business and consumer uncertainty in the face of the pandemic: A sector  analysis in European countries	Oscar Claveria	2020/12/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02091v1	ArXiv	This paper examines the evolution of business and consumer uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic in 32 European countries and the European Union (EU).Since uncertainty is not directly observable, we approximate it using the geometric discrepancy indicator of Claveria et al. (2019).This approach allows us quantifying the proportion of disagreement in business and consumer expectations of 32 countries.We have used information from all monthly forward-looking questions contained in Joint Harmonised Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys conducted by the European Commission (the industry survey, the service survey, the retail trade survey, the building survey and the consumer survey).First, we have calculated a discrepancy indicator for each of the 17 survey questions analysed, which allows us to approximate the proportion of uncertainty about different aspects of economic activity, both form the demand and the supply sides of the economy.We then use these indicators to calculate disagreement indices at the sector level.We graphic the evolution of the degree of uncertainty in the main economic sectors of the analysed economies up to June 2020.We observe marked differences, both across variables, sectors and countries since the inception of the COVID-19 crisis.Finally, by adding the sectoral indicators, an indicator of business uncertainty is calculated and compared with that of consumers.Again, we find substantial differences in the evolution of uncertainty between managers and consumers.This analysis seeks to offer a global overview of the degree of economic uncertainty in the midst of the coronavirus crisis at the sectoral level.	1001
Dr-COVID: Graph Neural Networks for SARS-CoV-2 Drug Repurposing	Siddhant Doshi,Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri	2020/12/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02151v1	ArXiv	The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in more than a million deaths, high morbidities, and economic distress worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify medications that would treat and prevent novel diseases like the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a promising strategy to discover new medical indications of the existing approved drugs due to several advantages in terms of the costs, safety factors, and quick results compared to new drug design and discovery. In this work, we explore computational data-driven methods for drug repurposing and propose a dedicated graph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID. Although we analyze the predicted drugs in detail for COVID-19, the model is generic and can be used for any novel diseases. We construct a four-layered heterogeneous graph to model the complex interactions between drugs, diseases, genes, and anatomies. We pose drug repurposing as a link prediction problem. Specifically, we design an encoder based on the scalable inceptive graph neural network (SIGN) to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the four-layered graph and propose a quadratic norm scorer as a decoder to predict treatment for a disease. We provide a detailed analysis of the 150 potential drugs (such as Dexamethasone, Ivermectin) predicted by Dr-COVID for COVID-19 from different pharmacological classes (e.g., corticosteroids, antivirals, antiparasitic). Out of these 150 drugs, 46 drugs are currently in clinical trials. Dr-COVID is evaluated in terms of its prediction performance and its ability to rank the known treatment drugs for diseases as high as possible. For a majority of the diseases, Dr-COVID ranks the actual treatment drug in the top 15.	1002
Should bike sharing continue operating during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Empirical findings from Nanjing, China	Mingzhuang Hua,Xuewu Chen,Long Cheng,Jingxu Chen	2020/12/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02946v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered a worldwide outbreak of pandemic, and transportation services have played a key role in coronavirus transmission. Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro car, bike sharing users will be exposed to the bike surface and take the transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike sharing. Based on the trip data of bike sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the perspective of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike sharing during the pandemic. The results show that pandemic control strategies sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly. Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and older adults are more dependent on bike sharing systems. Besides, the trip decrease reduces user contact and increases idle bikes. And a new concept of user distancing is proposed to avoid transmission risk and activate idle bikes. This study evaluates the role of shared micro-mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also inspires the blocking of viral transmission within the city.	1003
Epidemic spreading in an expanded parameter space: the supercritical  scaling laws and subcritical metastable phases	Gaetano Campi,Antonio Valletta,Andrea Perali,Augusto Marcelli,Antonio Bianconi	2020/12/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10230v1	ArXiv	So far most of the analysis of coronavirus 2020 epidemic data has been focusing on a short-time window and consequently a quantitative test of statistical physical laws of Coronavirus Epidemics with Containment Measures (CEwCM) is currently lacking. Here we report a quantitative analysis of CEwCM over 230 days, covering the full-time lapse of the first epidemic wave. We use a 3D phase diagram tracking the simultaneous evolution of the doubling time Td(t) and reproductive number Rt(t) showing that this expanded parameter space is needed for biological physics of CEwCP. We have verified that in the supercritical [Rt(t)>1, Td(t)<40 days] regime i) the curve Z(t) of total infected cases follows the growth rate called Ostwald law; ii) the doubling time follows the exponential law Td(t)=A exp((t-t0)/s) as a function of time and iii) the power law Td(t)=C(Rt(t)-1)^-n is verified with the exponent n depending on the definition of Rt(t). The log-log plots Td(t) versus (Rt-1) of the second 2020 epidemic wave unveil in the subcritical regime [Td(t)>100 days] arrested metastable phases with Rt>1 where Td(t) was kept constant followed by its explosion and its containment following the same power law as in the first wave	1004
Establishment of a diagnostic model to distinguish coronavirus disease  2019 from influenza A based on laboratory findings	Dongyang Xing,Suyan Tian,Yukun Chen,Jinmei Wang,Xuejuan Sun,Shanji Li,Jiancheng Xu	2020/12/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11889v1	ArXiv	Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Influenza A are common disease caused by viral infection. The clinical symptoms and transmission routes of the two diseases are similar. However, there are no relevant studies on laboratory diagnostic models to discriminate COVID-19 and influenza A. This study aims at establishing a signature of laboratory findings to tell patients with COVID-19 apart from those with influenza A perfectly. Materials: In this study, 56 COVID-19 patients and 54 influenza A patients were included. Laboratory findings, epidemiological characteristics and demographic data were obtained from electronic medical record databases. Elastic network models, followed by a stepwise logistic regression model were implemented to identify indicators capable of discriminating COVID-19 and influenza A. A nomogram is diagramed to show the resulting discriminative model. Results: The majority of hematological and biochemical parameters in COVID-19 patients were significantly different from those in influenza A patients. In the final model, albumin/globulin (A/G), total bilirubin (TBIL) and erythrocyte specific volume (HCT) were selected as predictors. Using an external dataset, the model was validated to perform well. Conclusion: A diagnostic model of laboratory findings was established, in which A/G, TBIL and HCT were included as highly relevant indicators for the segmentation of COVID-19 and influenza A, providing a complimentary means for the precise diagnosis of these two diseases.	1005
The HDvent Emergency Ventilator System	David Grimshandl,Manuel Gerken,Eleonora Lippi,Binh Tran,Saba Zia Hassan,Jan Hendrik Becher,Selim Jochim,Matthias Weidemüller,Gunnar Föhner,Steffen Brucker,Frank Schumacher,Wolfgang Beldermann,Venelin Angelov,Stefan Hetzel,Stefan Hummel,Simon Muley,Bernd Windelband,Christoph Eisner,Marco Zugaj,Philipp Bayer,Dario Ernst,Marcel Gehrlein,Helmut Jacob,Jens Pfeifle,Andreas Treskatsch,Martin Ulmschneider,Philipp M. Preiss	2020/12/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13005v1	ArXiv	The pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected countries all across the world, heavily burdening the medical infrastructure with the growing number of patients affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). With ventilators in limited supply, this public health emergency highlights the need for safe, fast, reliable, and economical alternatives to high-end commercial devices and has prompted the development of easy-to-use and mass-producible ventilators. Here, we detail the design of the HDvent Emergency Ventilator System. The device performs ventilation through mechanical compression of manual resuscitators and includes control electronics, flow and pressure sensors, and an external data visualization and monitoring unit. We demonstrate its suitability for open loop, pressure- and volume-controlled ventilation. The system has not undergone clinical testing and has not been approved for use as a medical device. The project documentation needed to reproduce the prototype is freely available and will contribute to the development of open source ventilation systems.	1006
Capacity Planning for Effective Cohorting of Dialysis Patients during  the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Case Study	Cem Bozkir,Cagri Ozmemis,Ali Kaan Kurbanzade,Burcu Balcik,Evrim Gunes,Serhan Tuglular	2021/02/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09302v1	ArXiv	Chronic dialysis patients have been among the most vulnerable groups of the society during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as they need regular treatments in a hospital environment, facing infection risk. Moreover, the demand for dialysis resources has significantly increased since many COVID-19 patients need acute dialysis due to kidney failure. In this study, we address capacity planning decisions of a hemodialysis clinic located within a major hospital in Istanbul, designated to serve both infected and uninfected patients during the pandemic with limited resources (i.e., dialysis machines). The hemodialysis clinic applies a three-unit cohorting strategy to treat four types of patients in separate units and at different times to mitigate infection spread risk among patients. Accordingly, at the beginning of each week, the clinic needs to determine the number of available dialysis machines to allocate to each unit that serves different patient cohorts. Given the uncertainties in the number of different types of patients that will need dialysis, it is a challenge to allocate the scarce dialysis resources effectively by evaluating which capacity configuration would minimize the overlapping treatment sessions of infected and uninfected patients over a week. We represent the uncertainties in the number of patients by a set of scenarios and present a two-stage stochastic programming approach to support capacity allocation decisions of the clinic. We present a case study based on the real-world patient data obtained from the clinic to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach and compare the performance of different cohorting strategies.	1007
Agent-Based Campus Novel Coronavirus Infection and Control Simulation	Pei Lv,Quan Zhang,Boya Xu,Ran Feng,Chaochao Li,Junxiao Xue,Bing Zhou,Mingliang Xu	2021/02/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10971v3	ArXiv	Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to its extremely high infectivity, has been spreading rapidly around the world and bringing huge influence to socioeconomic development as well as people's daily life. Taking for example the virus transmission that may occur after college students return to school, we analyze the quantitative influence of the key factors on the virus spread, including crowd density and self-protection. One Campus Virus Infection and Control Simulation model (CVICS) of the novel coronavirus is proposed in this paper, fully considering the characteristics of repeated contact and strong mobility of crowd in the closed environment. Specifically, we build an agent-based infection model, introduce the mean field theory to calculate the probability of virus transmission, and micro-simulate the daily prevalence of infection among individuals. The experimental results show that the proposed model in this paper efficiently simulate how the virus spread in the dense crowd in frequent contact under closed environment. Furthermore, preventive and control measures such as self-protection, crowd decentralization and isolation during the epidemic can effectively delay the arrival of infection peak and reduce the prevalence, and finally lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission after the students return to school.	1008
Managing mental & psychological wellbeing amidst COVID-19 pandemic:  Positive psychology interventions	Maria Tresita Paul V.,N. Uma Devi	2021/04/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11726v3	ArXiv	COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the roots of healthcare facilities worldwide, with the US being one of the most affected countries irrespective of being a superpower. Along with the current pandemic, COVID-19 can cause a secondary crisis of mental health pandemic if left unignored. Various studies from past epidemics, financial turmoil and pandemic, especially SARS and MERS, have shown a steep increase in mental and psychological issues like depression, low quality of life, self-harm and suicidal tendencies among general populations. The most venerable being the individuals infected and cured due to social discrimination. The government is taking steps to contain and prevent further infections of COVID-19. However, the mental and psychological wellbeing of people is still left ignored in developing countries like India. There is a significant gap in India concerning mental and psychological health still being stigmatized and considered 'non-existent'. This study's effort is to highlight the importance of mental and psychological health and to suggest interventions based on positive psychology literature. These interventions can support the wellbeing of people acting as a psychological first aid.

An Automated Approach for Timely Diagnosis and Prognosis of Coronavirus  Disease	Abbas Raza Ali,Marcin Budka	2021/04/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14116v1	ArXiv	Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), most of the impacted patients have been diagnosed with high fever, dry cough, and soar throat leading to severe pneumonia. Hence, to date, the diagnosis of COVID-19 from lung imaging is proved to be a major evidence for early diagnosis of the disease. Although nucleic acid detection using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) remains a gold standard for the detection of COVID-19, the proposed approach focuses on the automated diagnosis and prognosis of the disease from a non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT)scan for timely diagnosis and triage of the patient. The prognosis covers the quantification and assessment of the disease to help hospitals with the management and planning of crucial resources, such as medical staff, ventilators and intensive care units (ICUs) capacity. The approach utilises deep learning techniques for automated quantification of the severity of COVID-19 disease via measuring the area of multiple rounded ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations in the periphery (CP) of the lungs and accumulating them to form a severity score. The severity of the disease can be correlated with the medicines prescribed during the triage to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. The proposed approach shows promising results where the classification model achieved 93% accuracy on hold-out data.	1010
Generation of COVID-19 Chest CT Scan Images using Generative Adversarial  Networks	Prerak Mann,Sahaj Jain,Saurabh Mittal,Aruna Bhat	2021/05/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11241v1	ArXiv	SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 or Coronavirus, is a viral contagious disease that is infected by a novel coronavirus, and has been rapidly spreading across the globe. It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce spread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently. According to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is the current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer vision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can predict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The accuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of data for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease is relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the available chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by utilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and negative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded that around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19 positive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based classifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater accuracy.	1011
Topological data analysis identifies emerging adaptive mutations in  SARS-CoV-2	Michael Bleher,Lukas Hahn,Maximilian Neumann,Juan Angel Patino-Galindo,Mathieu Carriere,Ulrich Bauer,Raul Rabadan,Andreas Ott	2021/06/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07292v3	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated an unprecedented worldwide effort to characterize its evolution through the mapping of mutations of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The early identification of mutations that could confer adaptive advantages to the virus, such as higher infectivity or immune evasion, is of paramount importance. However, the large number of currently available genomes precludes the efficient use of phylogeny-based methods. Here we present CoVtRec, a fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach for the surveillance of emerging adaptive mutations in large genomic datasets. Our method overcomes limitations of state-of-the-art phylogeny-based approaches by quantifying the potential adaptiveness of mutations merely by their topological footprint in the genome alignment, without resorting to the reconstruction of a single optimal phylogenetic tree. Analyzing millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID, we find a correlation between topological signals and adaptation to the human host. By leveraging the stratification by time in sequence data, our method enables the high-resolution longitudinal analysis of topological signals of adaptation. We characterize the convergent evolution of the coronavirus throughout the whole pandemic to date, report on emerging potentially adaptive mutations, and pinpoint mutations in Variants of Concern that are likely associated with positive selection. Our approach can improve the surveillance of mutations of concern and guide experimental studies.	1012
Medical Imaging with Deep Learning for COVID- 19 Diagnosis: A  Comprehensive Review	Subrato Bharati,Prajoy Podder,M. Rubaiyat Hossain Mondal,V. B. Surya Prasath	2021/07/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09602v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) has claimed millions of lives and has affected all aspects of human life. This paper focuses on the application of deep learning (DL) models to medical imaging and drug discovery for managing COVID-19 disease. In this article, we detail various medical imaging-based studies such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images along with DL methods for classifying COVID-19 affected versus pneumonia. The applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL techniques in drug or vaccine discovery in combating the coronavirus. Finally, we address a number of problems, concerns and future research directions relevant to DL applications for COVID-19.	1013
Unstructured Handwashing Recognition using Smartwatch to Reduce Contact  Transmission of Pathogens	Emanuele Lattanzi,Lorenzo Calisti,Valerio Freschi	2021/07/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13405v4	ArXiv	Current guidelines from the World Health Organization indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which results in the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is transmitted through respiratory droplets or by contact. Contact transmission occurs when contaminated hands touch the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, or eyes so hands hygiene is extremely important to prevent the spread of the SARSCoV-2 as well as of other pathogens. The vast proliferation of wearable devices, such as smartwatches, containing acceleration, rotation, magnetic field sensors, etc., together with the modern technologies of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning and more recently deep-learning, allow the development of accurate applications for recognition and classification of human activities such as: walking, climbing stairs, running, clapping, sitting, sleeping, etc. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of a machine learning based system which, starting from inertial signals collected from wearable devices such as current smartwatches, recognizes when a subject is washing or rubbing its hands. Preliminary results, obtained over two different datasets, show a classification accuracy of about 95% and of about 94% for respectively deep and standard learning techniques.	1014
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data for Coronavirus (COVID-19)  Pandemic: A Survey on the State-of-the-Arts	Quoc-Viet Pham,Dinh C. Nguyen,Thien Huynh-The,Won-Joo Hwang,Pubudu N Pathirana	2021/07/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14040v1	ArXiv	The very first infected novel coronavirus case (COVID-19) was found in Hubei, China in Dec. 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread over 214 countries and areas in the world, and has significantly affected every aspect of our daily lives. At the time of writing this article, the numbers of infected cases and deaths still increase significantly and have no sign of a well-controlled situation, e.g., as of 13 July 2020, from a total number of around 13.1 million positive cases, 571, 527 deaths were reported in the world. Motivated by recent advances and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in various areas, this paper aims at emphasizing their importance in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak and preventing the severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We firstly present an overview of AI and big data, then identify the applications aimed at fighting against COVID-19, next highlight challenges and issues associated with state-of-the-art solutions, and finally come up with recommendations for the communications to effectively control the COVID-19 situation. It is expected that this paper provides researchers and communities with new insights into the ways AI and big data improve the COVID-19 situation, and drives further studies in stopping the COVID-19 outbreak.	1015
Analysis of pangolin metagenomic datasets reveals significant  contamination, raising concerns for pangolin CoV host attribution	Adrian Jones,Daoyu Zhang,Yuri Deigin,Steven C. Quay	2021/08/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08163v3	ArXiv	Metagenomic datasets from pangolin tissue specimens have previously yielded SARS-related coronaviruses which show high homology in their receptor binding domain to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a potential zoonotic source for this feature of the human virus, possibly via recombination (Liu et al. 2019, Lam et al. 2020, Xiao et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2020). Here we re-examine these published datasets. We report that only a few pangolin samples were found to contain coronavirus reads, and even then in low abundance, while other non-pangolin hosted viruses were present in higher abundance. We also discovered extensive contamination with human, rodent, and other mammalian gene sequences, which was a surprising finding. Furthermore, we uncovered a number of pangolin CoV sequences embedded in standard laboratory cloning vectors, which suggests the pangolin specimens could have been contaminated with sequences derived from synthetic biology experiments. Finally, we discover a third pangolin dataset (He et al. 2022) with low levels of SARSr-CoV sequences and unambiguous extensive contamination of several pangolin samples. For these reasons, we find it unlikely that the pangolins in question had a coronavirus infection while alive, and all current versions of the cited papers claiming a zoonotic infection of pangolins with a SARS-r CoV require substantial corrections and should be retracted until such corrections are made.	1016
CovXR: Automated Detection of COVID-19 Pneumonia in Chest X-Rays through  Machine Learning	Vishal Shenoy,Sachin B. Malik	2021/10/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06398v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the highly contagious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The standard diagnostic testing procedure for COVID-19 is testing a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can take multiple days to provide a diagnosis. Another widespread form of testing is rapid antigen testing, which has a low sensitivity compared to PCR, but is favored for its quick diagnosis time of usually 15-30 minutes. Patients who test positive for COVID-19 demonstrate diffuse alveolar damage in 87% of cases. Machine learning has proven to have advantages in image classification problems with radiology. In this work, we introduce CovXR as a machine learning model designed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia in chest X-rays (CXR). CovXR is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on over 4,300 chest X-rays. The performance of the model is measured through accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.5% and an F1 score of 0.954. The sensitivity is 93.5% and specificity is 97.5%. With accuracy above 95% and F1 score above 0.95, CovXR is highly accurate in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs. The model achieves better accuracy than prior work and uses a unique approach to identify COVID-19 pneumonia. CovXR is highly accurate in identifying COVID-19 on CXRs of patients with a PCR confirmed positive diagnosis and provides much faster results than PCR tests.	1017
Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Algorithms for Classification of  COVID-19 X-Ray Images	Unsa Maheen,Khawar Iqbal Malik,Gohar Ali	2021/10/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09294v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus was first emerged in December, in the city of China named Wuhan in 2019 and spread quickly all over the world. It has very harmful effects all over the global economy, education, social, daily living and general health of humans. To restrict the quick expansion of the disease initially, main difficulty is to explore the positive corona patients as quickly as possible. As there are no automatic tool kits accessible the requirement for supplementary diagnostic tools has risen up. Previous studies have findings acquired from radiological techniques proposed that this kind of images have important details related to the coronavirus. The usage of modified Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in combination with radio-graphical images can be fruitful for the precise and exact solution of this virus and can also be helpful to conquer the issue of deficiency of professional physicians in distant villages. In our research, we analyze the different techniques for the detection of COVID-19 using X-Ray radiographic images of the chest, we examined the different pre-trained CNN models AlexNet, VGG-16, MobileNet-V2, SqeezeNet, ResNet-34, ResNet-50 and COVIDX-Net to correct analytics for classification system of COVID-19. Our study shows that the pre trained CNN Model with ResNet-34 technique gives the higher accuracy rate of 98.33, 96.77% precision, and 98.36 F1-score, which is better than other CNN techniques. Our model may be helpful for the researchers to fine train the CNN model for the the quick screening of COVID patients.	1018
Operational Characterization of a Public Scientific Datacenter During  and Beyond the COVID-19 Period	Mehmet Berk Cetin	2021/10/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12244v1	ArXiv	Datacenters are imperative for the digital society. They offer services such as computing, telecommunication, media, and entertainment. Datacenters, however, consume a lot of power. Thus, Improving datacenter operations is important and may result in better services, reduced energy consumption and reduced costs. To improve datacenters, we must understand what is going on inside them. Therefore, we use operational traces from a scientific cluster in the Netherlands to investigate and understand how that cluster operates. Due to work-from-home circumstance, the covid period might have changed our daily usage of online applications, such as zoom and google meet. In this research, we focus on the operations of a scientific cluster (LISA) inside the SURF datacenter. The global pandemic might have changed how the LISA cluster operates. To understand the change, we collect, combine, and analyze operational logs from the LISA cluster. The tool to collect the data that belongs to the non-covid period was accomplished in previous research. Nonetheless, both the tool and instrument to combine and analyze the traces are lacking. This research focuses on designing an instrument that can combine and analyze the traces during and before the coronavirus period. The instrument can also produce graphs for customarily selected rack, nodes and periods. Moreover, we characterize the traces that belong to the coronavirus period using the scientific instrument and additional tools. The outcome of this research helps us understand how the operations for a scientific cluster (LISA) in the Netherlands has changed after the global pandemic.	1019
SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination using a Network of the United States Counties	Patrick Urrutia,David Wren,Chrysafis Vogiatzis,Ruriko Yoshida	2021/11/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13723v2	ArXiv	During 2020 and 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission has been increasing amongst the world's population at an alarming rate. Reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other diseases that are spread in similar manners is paramount for public health officials as they seek to effectively manage resources and potential population control measures such as social distancing and quarantines. By analyzing the United States' county network structure, one can model and interdict potential higher infection areas. County officials can provide targeted information, preparedness training, as well as increase testing in these areas. While these approaches may provide adequate countermeasures for localized areas, they are inadequate for the holistic United States. We solve this problem by collecting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections and deaths from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention{\color{black},} and {\color{black} adjacency between all counties obtained} from the United States Census Bureau. Generalized network autoregressive (GNAR) time series models have been proposed as an efficient learning algorithm for networked datasets. This work fuses network science and operations research techniques to univariately model COVID-19 cases, deaths, and current survivors across the United States' county network structure.	1020
Beyond COVID-19 Pandemic: Topology-aware optimisation of vaccination  strategy for minimising virus spreading	Francesco Petrizzelli,Pietro Hiram Guzzi,Tommaso Mazza	2022/02/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08229v1	ArXiv	The mitigation of an infectious disease spreading has recently gained considerable attention from the research community. It may be obtained by adopting sanitary measurements social rules, together with an extensive vaccination campaign. Vaccination is currently the primary way for mitigating the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak without severe lockdown. Its effectiveness also depends on the number and timeliness of administrations and thus demands strict prioritization criteria. Almost all countries have prioritized similar classes of exposed workers obtaining to maximize the survival of patients and years of life saved.

Nevertheless, the virus is currently spreading at high rates, and any prioritization criterion so far adopted did not account for the structural organization of the contact networks.	1021
Prediction of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images	Narayana Darapaneni,Suma Maram,Harpreet Singh,Syed Subhani,Mandeep Kour,Sathish Nagam,Anwesh Reddy Paduri	2022/04/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03849v1	ArXiv	COVID-19, also known as Novel Coronavirus Disease, is a highly contagious disease that first surfaced in China in late 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that belongs to the vast family of coronaviruses that causes this disease. The sickness originally appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and quickly spread to over 213 nations, becoming a global pandemic. Fever, dry cough, and tiredness are the most typical COVID-19 symptoms. Aches, pains, and difficulty breathing are some of the other symptoms that patients may face. The majority of these symptoms are indicators of respiratory infections and lung abnormalities, which radiologists can identify. Chest x-rays of COVID-19 patients seem similar, with patchy and hazy lungs rather than clear and healthy lungs. On x-rays, however, pneumonia and other chronic lung disorders can resemble COVID-19. Trained radiologists must be able to distinguish between COVID-19 and an illness that is less contagious. Our AI algorithm seeks to give doctors a quantitative estimate of the risk of deterioration. So that patients at high risk of deterioration can be triaged and treated efficiently. The method could be particularly useful in pandemic hotspots when screening upon admission is important for allocating limited resources like hospital beds.	1022
Mathematical artificial intelligence design of mutation-proof COVID-19  monoclonal antibodies	Jiahui Chen,Guo-Wei Wei	2022/04/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09471v1	ArXiv	Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have compromised existing vaccines and posed a grand challenge to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention, control, and global economic recovery. For COVID-19 patients, one of the most effective COVID-19 medications is monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has given the emergency use authorization (EUA) to a few mAbs, including those from Regeneron, Eli Elly, etc. However, they are also undermined by SARS-CoV-2 mutations. It is imperative to develop effective mutation-proof mAbs for treating COVID-19 patients infected by all emerging variants and/or the original SARS-CoV-2. We carry out a deep mutational scanning to present the blueprint of such mAbs using algebraic topology and artificial intelligence (AI). To reduce the risk of clinical trial-related failure, we select five mAbs either with FDA EUA or in clinical trials as our starting point. We demonstrate that topological AI-designed mAbs are effective to variants of concerns and variants of interest designated by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the original SARS-CoV-2. Our topological AI methodologies have been validated by tens of thousands of deep mutational data and their predictions have been confirmed by results from tens of experimental laboratories and population-level statistics of genome isolates from hundreds of thousands of patients.	1023
Evolution of viral pathogens follows a linear order	Zi Hian Tan,Kian Yan Yong,Jian-Jun Shu	2022/05/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05634v1	ArXiv	Although lessons have been learned from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, the rapid evolution of the viruses means that future outbreaks of a much larger scale are possible, as shown by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses as well as viruses in general. This study reports a comparative analysis of the amino acid usage within several key viral families and genera that are prone to triggering outbreaks, including coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E), influenza A (H1N1, H3N2), flavivirus (dengue virus serotypes 1-4, Zika) and ebolavirus (Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo ebolavirus). Our analysis reveals that the distribution of amino acid usage in the viral genome is constrained to follow a linear order, and the distribution remains closely related to the viral species within the family or genus. This constraint can be adapted to predict viral mutations and future variants of concern. By studying previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, we have adapted this naturally occurring pattern to determine that although pangolin plays a role in the outbreak of COVID-19, it may not be the sole agent as an intermediate animal. In addition to this study, our findings contribute to the understanding of viral mutations for subsequent development of vaccines and toward developing a model to determine the source of the outbreak.	1024
SmartMask- Developing an automated self-care system	Ruchita Bhadre,Prathamesh Yeole,Tejas Ranka,Rohini Mudhalwadkar	2022/06/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01492v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 has changed our world and has filled people with fear and anxiety. Everyone has a fear of coming in contact with people having the Coronavirus. In Spite of releasing full lockdowns, there is still a pressing need to maintain social distancing in the short- to medium-term to control the spread of coronavirus. Due to lack of self discipline or obviously pulling down the mask to get some fresh air, might pose a threat when you come near a person showing COVID symptoms. Abiding to WHO guidelines to avoid touching the mask while wearing it, we propose a wearable device for no contact pulling up of mask on face and additionally to implement social distancing with sensors mounted on the device. The SmartMask will detect if we are in the vicinity of any other person and will pull itself up. With sensors for detecting the closeness of objects around you and prompting you to take a proper action or pull the mask automatically. Along with the automated mask we will incorporate a temperature sensor to check vitals of an individual at all times and give an alert to the peers around him. This will ensure social distancing and help in avoiding spread of the virus.	1025
Coronavirus disease situation analysis and prediction using machine  learning: a study on Bangladeshi population	Al-Akhir Nayan,Boonserm Kijsirikul,Yuji Iwahori	2022/07/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13056v1	ArXiv	During a pandemic, early prognostication of patient infected rates can reduce the death by ensuring treatment facility and proper resource allocation. In recent months, the number of death and infected rates has increased more distinguished than before in Bangladesh. The country is struggling to provide moderate medical treatment to many patients. This study distinguishes machine learning models and creates a prediction system to anticipate the infected and death rate for the coming days. Equipping a dataset with data from March 1, 2020, to August 10, 2021, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model was trained. The data was managed from a trusted government website and concocted manually for training purposes. Several test cases determine the model's accuracy and prediction capability. The comparison between specific models assumes that the MLP model has more reliable prediction capability than the support vector regression (SVR) and linear regression model. The model presents a report about the risky situation and impending coronavirus disease (COVID-19) attack. According to the prediction produced by the model, Bangladesh may suffer another COVID-19 attack, where the number of infected cases can be between 929 to 2443 and death cases between 19 to 57.	1026
People detection and social distancing classification in smart cities  for COVID-19 by using thermal images and deep learning algorithms	Abdussalam Elhanashi,Sergio Saponara,Alessio Gagliardi	2022/09/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04704v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has resulted in an ongoing pandemic that caused infected cases including some deaths. Coronavirus is primarily spread between people during close contact. Motivating to this notion, this research proposes an artificial intelligence system for social distancing classification of persons by using thermal images. By exploiting YOLOv2 (you look at once), a deep learning detection technique is developed for detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence, this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling the persons in the images. The achieved results show that the proposed method is suitable for the creation of a smart surveillance system in smart cities for people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature analysis.	1027
Folding Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Transmembrane Peptides of  Influenza A, B M2, and MERS-, SARS-CoV E Viral Proteins	Antonios Kolocouris,Isaiah Arkin,Nicholas M. Glykos	2022/09/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05377v1	ArXiv	Viroporins are small viral proteins that oligomerize in the membrane of host cells and induce the formation of hydrophilic pores in these membranes, thus altering the physiological properties of the host cells. Due to their significance for viral pathogenicity, they have become targets for pharmaceutical intervention, especially through compounds that block their pore-forming activity. Here we add to the growing literature concerning the structure and function of viroporins by studying and comparing -- through molecular dynamics simulations -- the folding of the transmembrane domain peptides of viroporins derived from four viruses : influenza A, influenza B, and the coronaviruses MERS-Cov-2 and SARS-CoV-2. Through a total of more than 50 {\mu}s of simulation time in explicit solvent (TFE) and with full electrostatics, we characterize the folding behavior, helical stability and helical propensity of these transmembrane peptides in their monomeric state and we identify common motifs that may reflect their quaternary organization and/or biological function. We show that the two influenza-derived peptides are significantly different in peptide sequence and secondary structure from the two coronavirus-derived peptides, and that they are organized in two structurally distinct parts : a significantly more stable N-terminal half, and a fast converting C-terminal half that continuously folds and unfolds between $\alpha$-helical structures and non-canonical structures which are mostly turns. In contrast, the two coronavirus-derived transmembrane peptides are much more stable and fast helix formers when compared with the influenza ones. We discuss possible interpretations of these findings and their putative connection to the structural characteristics of the respective viroporins.	1028
A Benchmark Study by using various Machine Learning Models for  Predicting Covid-19 trends	D. Kamelesun,R. Saranya,P. Kathiravan	2023/01/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11257v1	ArXiv	Machine learning and deep learning play vital roles in predicting diseases in the medical field. Machine learning algorithms are widely classified as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. This paper contains a detailed description of our experimental research work in that we used a supervised machine-learning algorithm to build our model for outbreaks of the novel Coronavirus that has spread over the whole world and caused many deaths, which is one of the most disastrous Pandemics in the history of the world. The people suffered physically and economically to survive in this lockdown. This work aims to understand better how machine learning, ensemble, and deep learning models work and are implemented in the real dataset. In our work, we are going to analyze the current trend or pattern of the coronavirus and then predict the further future of the covid-19 confirmed cases or new cases by training the past Covid-19 dataset by using the machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, K-nearest neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random forest algorithm are used to train the model. The decision tree and the Random Forest algorithm perform better than SVR in this work. The performance of SVR and lasso regression are low in all prediction areas Because the SVR is challenging to separate the data using the hyperplane for this type of problem. So SVR mostly gives a lower performance in this problem. Ensemble (Voting, Bagging, and Stacking) and deep learning models(ANN) also predict well. After the prediction, we evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. This work aims to find the trend/pattern of the covid-19.	1029
A transfer learning approach with convolutional neural network for Face  Mask Detection	Abolfazl Younesi,Reza Afrouzian,Yousef Seyfari	2023/10/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18928v1	ArXiv	Due to the epidemic of the coronavirus (Covid-19) and its rapid spread around the world, the world has faced an enormous crisis. To prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced the use of masks and keeping social distance as the best preventive method. So, developing an automatic monitoring system for detecting facemasks in some crowded places is essential. To do this, we propose a mask recognition system based on transfer learning and Inception v3 architecture. In the proposed method, two datasets are used simultaneously for training including the Simulated Mask Face Dataset (SMFD) and MaskedFace-Net (MFN) This paper tries to increase the accuracy of the proposed system by optimally setting hyper-parameters and accurately designing the fully connected layers. The main advantage of the proposed method is that in addition to masked and unmasked faces, it can also detect cases of incorrect use of mask. Therefore, the proposed method classifies the input face images into three categories. Experimental results show the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method; so, this method has achieved an accuracy of 99.47% and 99.33% in training and test data respectively	1030
Predicting the evolution Of SARS-Covid-2 in Portugal using an adapted  SIR Model previously used in South Korea for the MERS outbreak	Pedro Teles	2020/03/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10047v2	ArXiv	The new coronavirus covid-19 has spread very quickly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of pandemic. One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario 1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\% effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the transmission rate $\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\%, In this scenario active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission rate $\beta$ was reduced to 70\% of its initial value, in which the number of cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\beta$ was reduced to 80\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about ~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.	1031
COVIDX-Net: A Framework of Deep Learning Classifiers to Diagnose  COVID-19 in X-Ray Images	Ezz El-Din Hemdan,Marwa A. Shouman,Mohamed Esmail Karar	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11055v1	ArXiv	Background and Purpose: Coronaviruses (CoV) are perilous viruses that may cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images. Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19 cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case. Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases, respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to classify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework. Clinical studies are the next milestone of this research work.	1032
Quantitative assessment of the role of undocumented infection in the  2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic	Yong-Shang Long,Zheng-Meng Zhai,Li-Lei Han,Jie Kang,Yi-Lin Li,Zhao-Hua Lin,Lang Zeng,Da-Yu Wu,Chang-Qing Hao,Ming Tang,Zonghua Liu,Ying-Cheng Lai	2020/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12028v1	ArXiv	An urgent problem in controlling COVID-19 spreading is to understand the role of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the hidden individuals.	1033
Nanomechanical sonification of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus spike protein  through a materiomusical approach	Markus J. Buehler	2020/03/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14258v1	ArXiv	Proteins are key building blocks of virtually all life, providing the material foundation of spider silk, cells, and hair, but also offering other functions from enzymes to drugs, and pathogens like viruses. Based on a nanomechanical analysis of the structure and motions of atoms and molecules at multiple scales, we report sonified versions of the coronavirus spike protein of the pathogen of COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. The audio signal, created using a novel nanomechanical sonification method, features an overlay of the vibrational signatures of the protein's primary, secondary and higher-order structures. Presenting musical encoding in two versions - one in the amino-acid scale and one based on equal temperament tuning - the method allows for expressing protein structures in audible space, offering novel avenues to represent, analyze and design architectural features across length- and time-scales. We further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other applications of audible coding of matter include material design by manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as materiomusic, which is akin to finding a new palette of colors for a painter. Here, the nanomechanical structure of matter, reflected in an oscillatory framework, presents a new palette for sound generation, and can complement or support human creativity.	1034
A Multi-Dimensional Big Data Storing System for Generated COVID-19  Large-Scale Data using Apache Spark	Manar A. Elmeiligy,Ali I. El Desouky,Sally M. Elghamrawy	2020/04/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05036v1	ArXiv	The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had burst out in Wuhan China, specifically in December 2019. COVID-19 has caused by a new virus that had not been identified in human previously. This was followed by a widespread and rapid spread of this epidemic throughout the world. Daily, the number of the confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases, based on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of the deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases around the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with different situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which symptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to construct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated large-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19 data using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the problem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in decreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data. CSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing, and querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and then index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes to store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying processes. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing with large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A set of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the efficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.	1035
Remote health monitoring and diagnosis in the time of COVID-19	Joachim A. Behar,Chengyu Liu,Kevin Kotzen,Kenta Tsutsui,Valentina D. A. Corino,Janmajay Singh,Marco A. F. Pimentel,Philip Warrick,Sebastian Zaunseder,Fernando Andreotti,David Sebag,Georgy Popanitsa,Patrick E. McSharry,Walter Karlen,Chandan Karmakar,Gari D. Clifford	2020/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08537v5	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is rapidly spreading across the globe. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases and requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID- 19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels). Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the pandemic. We emphasize in the discussion particular aspects that are common ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic on remote health monitoring and consideration on data privacy.	1036
Critical Impact of Social Networks Infodemic on Defeating Coronavirus  COVID-19 Pandemic: Twitter-Based Study and Research Directions	Azzam Mourad,Ali Srour,Haidar Harmanani,Cathia Jenainatiy,Mohamad Arafeh	2020/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08820v1	ArXiv	News creation and consumption has been changing since the advent of social media. An estimated 2.95 billion people in 2019 used social media worldwide. The widespread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 resulted with a tsunami of social media. Most platforms were used to transmit relevant news, guidelines and precautions to people. According to WHO, uncontrolled conspiracy theories and propaganda are spreading faster than the COVID-19 pandemic itself, creating an infodemic and thus causing psychological panic, misleading medical advises, and economic disruption. Accordingly, discussions have been initiated with the objective of moderating all COVID-19 communications, except those initiated from trusted sources such as the WHO and authorized governmental entities. This paper presents a large-scale study based on data mined from Twitter. Extensive analysis has been performed on approximately one million COVID-19 related tweets collected over a period of two months. Furthermore, the profiles of 288,000 users were analyzed including unique users profiles, meta-data and tweets context. The study noted various interesting conclusions including the critical impact of the (1) exploitation of the COVID-19 crisis to redirect readers to irrelevant topics and (2) widespread of unauthentic medical precautions and information. Further data analysis revealed the importance of using social networks in a global pandemic crisis by relying on credible users with variety of occupations, content developers and influencers in specific fields. In this context, several insights and findings have been provided while elaborating computing and non-computing implications and research directions for potential solutions and social networks management strategies during crisis periods.	1037
Molecular Characterization of Ebselen Binding Activity to SARS-CoV-2  Main Protease	Cintia A. Menendez,Fabian Bylehn,Gustavo R. Perez-Lemus,Walter Alvarado,Juan J. de Pablo	2020/05/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09805v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity. Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.	1038
Pandemic News: Facebook Pages of Mainstream News Media and the  Coronavirus Crisis -- A Computational Content Analysis	Thorsten Quandt,Svenja Boberg,Tim Schatto-Eckrodt,Lena Frischlich	2020/05/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13290v2	ArXiv	The unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for news media around the globe. While journalism is meant to process yet unknown events by design, the dynamically evolving situation affected all aspects of life in such profound ways that even the routines of crisis reporting seemed to be insufficient. Critics noted tendencies to horse-race reporting and uncritical coverage, with journalism being too close to official statements and too affirmative of political decisions. However, empirical data on the performance of journalistic news media during the crisis has been lacking thus far. The current study analyzes the Facebook messages of journalistic news media during the early Coronavirus crisis, based on a large German data set from January to March 2020. Using computational content analysis methods, reach and interactions, topical structure, relevant actors, negativity of messages, as well as the coverage of fabricated news and conspiracy theories were examined. The topical structure of the near-time Facebook coverage changed during various stages of the crisis, with just partial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat lacking in topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage on Corona-related issues and societal concerns. Further, journalistic media covered fake news and conspiracy theories during the crisis, but they consistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false claims circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of journalism during the crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did not find overwhelming signs of systemic dysfunctionalities. Overall, journalistic media did not default to a uniform reaction nor to sprawling, information-poor pandemic news, but they responded with a multi-perspective coverage of the crisis.	1039
Attacking COVID-19 Progression using Multi-Drug Therapy for Synergetic  Target Engagement	Mathew Coban,Juliet Morrison PhD,William D. Freeman MD,Evette Radisky PhD,Karine G. Le Roch PhD,Thomas R. Caulfield PhD	2020/07/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02557v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 is a devastating respiratory and inflammatory illness caused by a new coronavirus that is rapidly spreading throughout the human population. Over the past 6 months, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, has already infected over 11.6 million (25% located in United States) and killed more than 540K people around the world. As we face one of the most challenging times in our recent history, there is an urgent need to identify drug candidates that can attack SARS-CoV-2 on multiple fronts. We have therefore initiated a computational dynamics drug pipeline using molecular modeling, structure simulation, docking and machine learning models to predict the inhibitory activity of several million compounds against two essential SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and their host protein interactors; S/Ace2, Tmprss2, Cathepsins L and K, and Mpro to prevent binding, membrane fusion and replication of the virus, respectively. All together we generated an ensemble of structural conformations that increase high quality docking outcomes to screen over >6 million compounds including all FDA-approved drugs, drugs under clinical trial (>3000) and an additional >30 million selected chemotypes from fragment libraries. Our results yielded an initial set of 350 high value compounds from both new and FDA-approved compounds that can now be tested experimentally in appropriate biological model systems. We anticipate that our results will initiate screening campaigns and accelerate the discovery of COVID-19 treatments.	1040
Efficient Facemask Sterilization via Forced Ozone Convection	Joseph Schwan,Troy R. Alva,Giorgio Nava,Carla Berrospe Rodriguez,Justin W. Chartron,Joshua Morgan,Lorenzo Mangolini	2020/07/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09280v1	ArXiv	During the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic took the world by surprise, rapidly spreading undetected between and within many countries and wreaking havoc on the global economy both through death tolls and lockdowns. Healthcare professionals treating the coronavirus patients grapple with a massive and unprecedented shortage of Facepiece Respirators (FPRs) and other personal protective equipment (PPE), which act as fundamental tools to protect the health of the medical staff treating the patients affected by the coronavirus. While many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use devices, the development of sterilization strategies is necessary to circumvent future shortages. Here, we describe the development of a plasma-based method to sterilize PPE such as FPRs with ozone. The novel design uses a flow-through configuration where ozone directly flows through the fibers of the PPE through the maintenance of a pressure gradient. Canonical ozone-based methods place the mask into a sealed ozone-containing enclosure but lack pressurization to permeate the mask fibers. In this device, ozone is created through an atmospheric pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) fed with compressed air. Due to limited supply and clinical need of FPRs, we demonstrated sterilization with surgical masks. We demonstrate rapid sterilization using E. coli as a model pathogen. A flow-through configuration enables a >400% improvement of the sterilization efficiency with respect to the canonical approach. This method has potential for a broad and cost-effective utilization. Using the power supply from a readily available plasma ball toy, a plastic box, a glass tube, steel mesh, and 3D printed components, we designed and tested an extremely affordable portable prototype system for rapid single mask sterilization which produced comparable results to its large high-cost equivalent.	1041
Automated Detection and Forecasting of COVID-19 using Deep Learning  Techniques: A Review	Afshin Shoeibi,Marjane Khodatars,Mahboobeh Jafari,Navid Ghassemi,Delaram Sadeghi,Parisa Moridian,Ali Khadem,Roohallah Alizadehsani,Sadiq Hussain,Assef Zare,Zahra Alizadeh Sani,Fahime Khozeimeh,Saeid Nahavandi,U. Rajendra Acharya,Juan M. Gorriz	2020/07/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10785v7	ArXiv	Coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a hazardous disease that has endangered the health of many people around the world by directly affecting the lungs. COVID-19 is a medium-sized, coated virus with a single-stranded RNA, and also has one of the largest RNA genomes and is approximately 120 nm. The X-Ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging modalities are widely used to obtain a fast and accurate medical diagnosis. Identifying COVID-19 from these medical images is extremely challenging as it is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Hence, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies can be used to obtain consistent high performance. Among the AI methods, deep learning (DL) networks have gained popularity recently compared to conventional machine learning (ML). Unlike ML, all stages of feature extraction, feature selection, and classification are accomplished automatically in DL models. In this paper, a complete survey of studies on the application of DL techniques for COVID-19 diagnostic and segmentation of lungs is discussed, concentrating on works that used X-Ray and CT images. Additionally, a review of papers on the forecasting of coronavirus prevalence in different parts of the world with DL is presented. Lastly, the challenges faced in the detection of COVID-19 using DL techniques and directions for future research are discussed.	1042
Advanced and comprehensive research on the dynamics of COVID-19 under  mass communication outlets intervention and quarantine strategy: a  deterministic and probabilistic approach	Driss Kiouach,Salim El Azami El-idrissi,Yassine Sabbar	2021/01/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00517v1	ArXiv	The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major crisis that has significantly affected the healthcare sector and global economies, which made it the main subject of various fields in scientific and technical research. To properly understand and control this new epidemic, mathematical modelling is presented as a very effective tool that can illustrate the mechanisms of its propagation. In this regard, the use of compartmental models is the most prominent approach adopted in the literature to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. Along the same line, we aim during this study to generalize and ameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of this epidemic. Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR epidemic system for Coronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched by taking into account the media intervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation matrix method, the theoretical basic reproductive number $R_0$ is obtained for COVID-19. Based on some nonstandard and generalized analytical techniques, the local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium are proven when $R_0 < 1$. Moreover, in the case of $R_0 > 1$, the uniform persistence of COVID-19 model is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic model to reality, the randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white noises, which leads to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate conditions, interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: extinction and persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed COVID-19 model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the magnitude of the stochastic noise. Finally, we present some numerical illustrations to confirm our theoretical results and to show the impact of media intervention and quarantine strategies.	1043
Quantitative Interpretations of Energetic Features and Key Residues at  SARS Coronavirus Spike Receptor-Binding Domain and ACE2 Receptor Interface	Yanmei Yang,Yunju Zhang,Yuanyuan Qu,Xuewei Liu,Mingwen Zhao,Yuguang Mu,Weifeng Li	2021/03/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06578v1	ArXiv	The wide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has declared a global health emergency. As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug developments, Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly evaluated the binding energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to find the key residues. Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding affinity is as large as -16.35 kcal/mol. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501, Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc) which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces are from van der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. It is also worth mention that we found seven mutational sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476, Glu484, Gln498 and Val503) on SARS-CoV-2 which unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Very interestingly, the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface (E484), is found to be mutated in the latest UK variant, B1.1.7, cause complete virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Our present results indicate that at least from the energetic point of view such E484 mutation may have beneficial effects on ACE2 binding. The present study provides a systematical understanding, from the energetic point of view, of the binding features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 acceptor. We hope that the present findings of three binding patches, key attracting residues and unexpected mutational sites can provide insights to the design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of cross-active antibodies.	1044
Laotian Bat Sarbecovirus BANAL-236 Uses ACE2 to Infect Cells by an  Unknown Mechanism	Steven Carl Quay	2021/12/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06141v2	ArXiv	A manuscript identified bat sarbecoviruses with high sequence homology to SARS-CoV-2 found in caves in Laos that can directly infect human cells via the human ACE2 receptor (Coronaviruses with a SARS-CoV-2-like receptor binding domain allowing ACE2-mediated entry into human cells isolated from bats of Indochinese peninsula, Temmam S., et al.). Here, I examine the genomic sequence of one of these viruses, BANAL-236, and show it has 5-UTR and 3-UTR secondary structures that are non-canonical and, in fact, have never been seen in an infective coronavirus. Specifically, the 5-UTR has a 177 nt copy-back extension which forms an extended, highly stable duplex RNA structure. Because of this copy-back, the four obligate Stem Loops (SL) -1, -2, -3, and -4 cis-acting elements found in all currently known replicating coronaviruses are buried in the extended duplex. The 3-UTR has a similar fold-back duplex of 144 nts and is missing the obligate poly-A tail. Taken together, these findings demonstrate BANAL-236 is missing eight obligate UTR cis-acting elements; each one of which has previously been lethal to replication when modified individually. Neither duplex copyback has ever been observed in an infective sarbecovirus, although some of the features have been seen in defective interfering particles, which can be found in co-infections with non-defective, replicating viruses. They are also a common error seen during synthetic genome assembly in a laboratory. BANAL-236 must have evolved an entirely unique mechanism for replication, RNA translation, and RNA packaging never seen in a coronavirus and because it is a bat sarbecovirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative that we understand its unique mode of infectivity by a collaborative, international research effort.	1045
PWM2Vec: An Efficient Embedding Approach for Viral Host Specification  from Coronavirus Spike Sequences	Sarwan Ali,Babatunde Bello,Prakash Chourasia,Ria Thazhe Punathil,Yijing Zhou,Murray Patterson	2022/01/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02273v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 pandemic, is still unknown and is an important open question. There are speculations that bats are a possible origin. Likewise, there are many closely related (corona-) viruses, such as SARS, which was found to be transmitted through civets. The study of the different hosts which can be potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to understanding, mitigating and preventing current and future pandemics. In coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is an important part of determining host specificity since it is the point of contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. In this paper, we classify the hosts of over five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating them into clusters of distinct hosts among avians, bats, camels, swines, humans and weasels, to name a few. We propose a feature embedding based on the well-known position-weight matrix (PWM), which we call PWM2Vec, and use to generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these coronaviruses. While our embedding is inspired by the success of PWMs in biological applications such as determining protein function, or identifying transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to use PWMs in the context of host classification from viral sequences to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation. The results on the real world data show that in using PWM2Vec, we are able to perform comparably well as compared to baseline models. We also measure the importance of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus.	1046
Privacy-aware Early Detection of COVID-19 through Adversarial Training	Omid Rohanian,Samaneh Kouchaki,Andrew Soltan,Jenny Yang,Morteza Rohanian,Yang Yang,David Clifton	2022/01/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03004v1	ArXiv	Early detection of COVID-19 is an ongoing area of research that can help with triage, monitoring and general health assessment of potential patients and may reduce operational strain on hospitals that cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Different machine learning techniques have been used in the literature to detect coronavirus using routine clinical data (blood tests, and vital signs). Data breaches and information leakage when using these models can bring reputational damage and cause legal issues for hospitals. In spite of this, protecting healthcare models against leakage of potentially sensitive information is an understudied research area. In this work, we examine two machine learning approaches, intended to predict a patient's COVID-19 status using routinely collected and readily available clinical data. We employ adversarial training to explore robust deep learning architectures that protect attributes related to demographic information about the patients. The two models we examine in this work are intended to preserve sensitive information against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In a series of experiments using datasets from the Oxford University Hospitals, Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, and Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust we train and test two neural networks that predict PCR test results using information from basic laboratory blood tests, and vital signs performed on a patients' arrival to hospital. We assess the level of privacy each one of the models can provide and show the efficacy and robustness of our proposed architectures against a comparable baseline. One of our main contributions is that we specifically target the development of effective COVID-19 detection models with built-in mechanisms in order to selectively protect sensitive attributes against adversarial attacks.	1047
Detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Associated Pneumonia based on  Generative Adversarial Networks and a Fine-Tuned Deep Transfer Learning Model  using Chest X-ray Dataset	Nour Eldeen M. Khalifa,Mohamed Hamed N. Taha,Aboul Ella Hassanien,Sally Elghamrawy	2020/04/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01184v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the devastating viruses according to the world health organization. This novel virus leads to pneumonia, which is an infection that inflames the lungs' air sacs of a human. One of the methods to detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10% of the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the complexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination of GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most appropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and achieved 99% with the other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score while using GAN as an image augmenter. Finally, a comparison result was carried out at the end of the research with related work which used the same dataset except that this research used only 10% of original dataset. The presented work achieved a superior result than the related work in terms of testing accuracy.	1048
One-shot screening of potential peptide ligands on HR1 domain in  COVID-19 glycosylated spike (S) protein with deep siamese network	Nicolò Savioli	2020/04/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02136v3	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been declared to be a new international health emergence and no specific drug has been yet identified. Several methods are currently being evaluated such as protease and glycosylated spike (S) protein inhibitors, that outlines the main fusion site among coronavirus and host cells. Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the glycosylated spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the most encouraging target for new inhibitors drugs.The novelty of the proposed approach, compared to others, lies in a precise training of a deep neural network toward the 2019-nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been trained to distingue the whole 2019-nCoV protein sequence amongst two different viruses family such as HIV-1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep learning system has precise knowledge of peptide linkage among 2019-nCoV protein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained on public datasets that have not been provided any ligand-peptide information for 2019-nCoV. Suddenly, the SNN shows a sensitivity of $83\%$ of peptide affinity classification, where $3027$ peptides on SATPdb bank have been tested towards the specific region HR1 of 2019-nCoV exhibiting an affinity of $93\%$ for the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) peptide. This affinity between PPIase and HR1 can open new horizons of research since several scientific papers have already shown that CsA immunosuppression drug, a main inhibitor of PPIase, suppress the reproduction of different CoV virus included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, to ensure the scientific reproducibility, code and data have been made public at the following link: https://github.com/bionick87/2019-nCoV	1049
Mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical  interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel Coronavirus	Calistus N. Ngonghala,Enahoro Iboi,Steffen Eikenberry,Matthew Scotch,Chandini Raina MacIntyre,Matthew H. Bonds,Abba B. Gumel	2020/04/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07391v2	ArXiv	A novel Coronavirus pandemic emerged in December of 2019, causing devastating public health impact across the world. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of these mitigation strategies. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission in New York state and the entire US, show that the pandemic will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in New York State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that early termination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict social-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%) could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of other anti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic. The mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use is combined with strict social-distancing.	1050
Automatic Detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in X-ray and CT  Images: A Machine Learning-Based Approach	Sara Hosseinzadeh Kassani,Peyman Hosseinzadeh Kassasni,Michal J. Wesolowski,Kevin A. Schneider,Ralph Deters	2020/04/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10641v1	ArXiv	The newly identified Coronavirus pneumonia, subsequently termed COVID-19, is highly transmittable and pathogenic with no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available for treatment. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress to a severe form of pneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. While medical imaging is not currently recommended in Canada for primary diagnosis of COVID-19, computer-aided diagnosis systems could assist in the early detection of COVID-19 abnormalities and help to monitor the progression of the disease, potentially reduce mortality rates. In this study, we compare popular deep learning-based feature extraction frameworks for automatic COVID-19 classification. To obtain the most accurate feature, which is an essential component of learning, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, ResNet, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, VGGNet, NASNet were chosen amongst a pool of deep convolutional neural networks. The extracted features were then fed into several machine learning classifiers to classify subjects as either a case of COVID-19 or a control. This approach avoided task-specific data pre-processing methods to support a better generalization ability for unseen data. The performance of the proposed method was validated on a publicly available COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray and CT images. The DenseNet121 feature extractor with Bagging tree classifier achieved the best performance with 99% classification accuracy. The second-best learner was a hybrid of the a ResNet50 feature extractor trained by LightGBM with an accuracy of 98%.	1051
Repurposing drugs for COVID-19 based on transcriptional response of host  cells to SARS-CoV-2	Fuhai Li,Andrew P. Michelson,Randi Foraker,Ming Zhan,Philip R. O. Payne	2020/06/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01226v2	ArXiv	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over 10 million people globally with a relatively high mortality rate. There are many therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling of host cells plays critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, and drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially effective for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify these potential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing drugs as a potentially effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeutic discovery, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. We first identified dysfunctional signaling pathways associated with the infection caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis of the altered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathway analysis, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies were identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly identified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and reverse gene expression data resources. The dexamethasone was top-ranked in the prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. The results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling pathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for COVID-19 treatment.	1052
SAveRUNNER: a network-based algorithm for drug repurposing and its  application to COVID-19	Giulia Fiscon,Federica Conte,Lorenzo Farina,Paola Paci	2020/06/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03110v3	ArXiv	The novelty of new human coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these strategies rely on the repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14 selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic similarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs tentatively repurposed to treat COVID-19. Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19 treatments, as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs, actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect against human coronavirus infections.	1053

Eklund,Thien Huynh-The,Thanh Tam Nguyen,Quoc-Viet Pham,Imran Razzak,Edbert B. Hsu	2020/07/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07343v4	ArXiv	Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied widely in our daily lives in a variety of ways with numerous success stories. AI has also contributed to dealing with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been happening around the globe. This paper presents a survey of AI methods being used in various applications in the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak and outlines the crucial role of AI research in this unprecedented battle. We touch on areas where AI plays as an essential component, from medical image processing, data analytics, text mining and natural language processing, the Internet of Things, to computational biology and medicine. A summary of COVID-19 related data sources that are available for research purposes is also presented. Research directions on exploring the potential of AI and enhancing its capability and power in the pandemic battle are thoroughly discussed. We identify 13 groups of problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight promising AI methods and tools that can be used to address these problems. It is envisaged that this study will provide AI researchers and the wider community with an overview of the current status of AI applications, and motivate researchers to harness AI's potential in the fight against COVID-19.	1054
Real-time Prediction of COVID-19 related Mortality using Electronic  Health Records	Patrick Schwab,Arash Mehrjou,Sonali Parbhoo,Leo Anthony Celi,Jürgen Hetzel,Markus Hofer,Bernhard Schölkopf,Stefan Bauer	2020/08/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13412v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with rapid human-to-human transmission and a high case fatality rate particularly in older patients. Due to the exponential growth of infections, many healthcare systems across the world are under pressure to care for increasing amounts of at-risk patients. Given the high number of infected patients, identifying patients with the highest mortality risk early is critical to enable effective intervention and optimal prioritisation of care. Here, we present the COVID-19 Early Warning System (CovEWS), a clinical risk scoring system for assessing COVID-19 related mortality risk. CovEWS provides continuous real-time risk scores for individual patients with clinically meaningful predictive performance up to 192 hours (8 days) in advance, and is automatically derived from patients' electronic health records (EHRs) using machine learning. We trained and evaluated CovEWS using de-identified data from a cohort of 66430 COVID-19 positive patients seen at over 69 healthcare institutions in the United States (US), Australia, Malaysia and India amounting to an aggregated total of over 2863 years of patient observation time. On an external test cohort of 5005 patients, CovEWS predicts COVID-19 related mortality from $78.8\%$ ($95\%$ confidence interval [CI]: $76.0$, $84.7\%$) to $69.4\%$ ($95\%$ CI: $57.6, 75.2\%$) specificity at a sensitivity greater than $95\%$ between respectively 1 and 192 hours prior to observed mortality events - significantly outperforming existing generic and COVID-19 specific clinical risk scores. CovEWS could enable clinicians to intervene at an earlier stage, and may therefore help in preventing or mitigating COVID-19 related mortality.	1055
Decision and Feature Level Fusion of Deep Features Extracted from Public  COVID-19 Data-sets	Hamza Osman Ilhan,Gorkem Serbes,Nizamettin Aydin	2020/11/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08528v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is an infectious pulmonary disorder, has affected millions of people and has been declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. Due to highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high possibility of causing severe conditions in the patients, the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools have gained importance. The real-time reverse transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the presence of Coronavirus RNA by using the mucus and saliva mixture samples. But, RT-PCR suffers from having low-sensitivity especially in the early stage. Therefore, the usage of chest radiography has been increasing in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 due to its fast imaging speed, significantly low cost and low dosage exposure of radiation. In our study, a computer-aided diagnosis system for X-ray images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be used by radiologists as a supporting tool in COVID-19 detection, has been proposed. Deep feature sets extracted by using CNNs were concatenated for feature level fusion and fed to multiple classifiers in terms of decision level fusion idea with the aim of discriminating COVID-19, pneumonia and no-finding classes. In the decision level fusion idea, a majority voting scheme was applied to the resultant decisions of classifiers. The obtained accuracy values and confusion matrix based evaluation criteria were presented for three progressively created data-sets. The aspects of the proposed method that are superior to existing COVID-19 detection studies have been discussed and the fusion performance of proposed approach was validated visually by using Class Activation Mapping technique. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has attained high COVID-19 detection performance that was proven by its comparable accuracy and superior precision/recall values with the existing studies.	1056
Deep Neural Networks for COVID-19 Detection and Diagnosis using Images  and Acoustic-based Techniques: A Recent Review	Walid Hariri,Ali Narin	2020/12/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07655v4	ArXiv	The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic since March 2020 by the World Health Organization. It consists of an emerging viral infection with respiratory tropism that could develop atypical pneumonia. Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone, alternative early-screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning (DL) algorithms, which have been popular in recent years, have been comprehensively discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches used in literature are examined in detail. The Computed Tomography of the chest and X-ray images give a rich representation of the patient's lung that is less time-consuming and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection using the DL algorithms. The first step is the pre-processing of these images to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep models (pre-trained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.). Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease. In this study, we also give a brief review of the latest applications of cough analysis to early screen the COVID-19, and human mobility estimation to limit its spread.	1057
Methodology-centered review of molecular modeling, simulation, and  prediction of SARS-CoV-2	Kaifu Gao,Rui Wang,Jiahui Chen,Limei Cheng,Jaclyn Frishcosy,Yuta Huzumi,Yuchi Qiu,Tom Schluckbier,Guo-Wei Wei	2021/02/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00971v1	ArXiv	The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has gone out of control globally. Despite much effort by scientists, medical experts, and society in general, the slow progress on drug discovery and antibody therapeutic development, the unknown possible side effects of the existing vaccines, and the high transmission rate of the SARS-CoV-2, remind us of the sad reality that our current understanding of the transmission, infectivity, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is unfortunately very limited. The major limitation is the lack of mechanistic understanding of viral-host cell interactions, the viral regulation, protein-protein interactions, including antibody-antigen binding, protein-drug binding, host immune response, etc. This limitation will likely haunt the scientific community for a long time and have a devastating consequence in combating COVID-19 and other pathogens. Notably, compared to the long-cycle, highly cost, and safety-demanding molecular-level experiments, the theoretical and computational studies are economical, speedy, and easy to perform. There exists a tsunami of the literature on molecular modeling, simulation, and prediction of SARS-CoV-2 that has become impossible to fully be covered in a review. To provide the reader a quick update about the status of molecular modeling, simulation, and prediction of SARS-CoV-2, we present a comprehensive and systematic methodology-centered narrative in the nick of time. Aspects such as molecular modeling, Monte Carlo (MC) methods, structural bioinformatics, machine learning, deep learning, and mathematical approaches are included in this review. This review will be beneficial to researchers who are looking for ways to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 studies and those who are assessing the current status in the field.	1058
Insight about Detection, Prediction and Weather Impact of Coronavirus  (Covid-19) using Neural Network	A K M Bahalul Haque,Tahmid Hasan Pranto,Abdulla All Noman,Atik Mahmood	2021/04/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02173v1	ArXiv	The world is facing a tough situation due to the catastrophic pandemic caused by novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The number people affected by this virus are increasing exponentially day by day and the number has already crossed 6.4 million. As no vaccine has been discovered yet, the early detection of patients and isolation is the only and most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus. Detecting infected persons from chest X-Ray by using Deep Neural Networks, can be applied as a time and laborsaving solution. In this study, we tried to detect Covid-19 by classification of Covid-19, pneumonia and normal chest X-Rays. We used five different Convolutional Pre-Trained Neural Network models (VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3 and Resnet50) and compared their performance. VGG16 and VGG19 shows precise performance in classification. Both models can classify between three kinds of X-Rays with an accuracy over 92%. Another part of our study was to find the impact of weather factors (temperature, humidity, sun hour and wind speed) on this pandemic using Decision Tree Regressor. We found that temperature, humidity and sun-hour jointly hold 85.88% impact on escalation of Covid-19 and 91.89% impact on death due to Covid-19 where humidity has 8.09% impact on death. We also tried to predict the death of an individual based on age, gender, country, and location due to COVID-19 using the LogisticRegression, which can predict death of an individual with a model accuracy of 94.40%.	1059
Trends in Remote Learning-based Google Shopping in the United States due  to COVID-19	Isabella Hall,Nirmalya Thakur,Chia Y. Han	2022/04/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12654v1	ArXiv	The United States of America has been the worst affected country in terms of the number of cases and deaths on account of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19, a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that started spreading globally in late 2019. On account of the surge of infections, accompanied by hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19, and lack of a definitive cure at that point, a national emergency was declared in the United States on March 13, 2020. To prevent the rapid spread of the virus, several states declared stay at home and remote work guidelines shortly after this declaration of an emergency. Such guidelines caused schools, colleges, and universities, both private and public, in all the 50-United States to switch to remote or online forms of teaching for a significant period of time. As a result, Google, the most widely used search engine in the United States, experienced a surge in online shopping of remote learning-based software, systems, applications, and gadgets by both educators and students from all the 50-United States, due to both these groups responding to the associated needs and demands related to switching to remote teaching and learning. This paper aims to investigate, analyze, and interpret these trends of Google Shopping related to remote learning that emerged since March 13, 2020, on account of COVID-19 and the subsequent remote learning adoption in almost all schools, colleges, and universities, from all the 50-United States. The study was performed using Google Trends, which helps to track and study Google Shopping-based online activity emerging from different geolocations. The results and discussions show that the highest interest related to Remote Learning-based Google Shopping was recorded from Oregon, which was followed by Illinois, Florida, Texas, California, and the other states.	1060
COVID-19 Literature Mining and Retrieval using Text Mining Approaches	Sanku Satya Uday,Satti Thanuja Pavani,T. Jaya Lakshmi,Rohit Chivukula	2022/05/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14781v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and to date has infected over 148M people worldwide, resulting in 3.12M deaths. On March 10, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it as a global pandemic. Many academicians and researchers started to publish papers describing the latest discoveries on covid-19. The large influx of publications made it hard for other researchers to go through a large amount of data and find the appropriate one that helps their research. So, the proposed model attempts to extract relavent titles from the large corpus of research publications which makes the job easy for the researchers. Allen Institute for AI released the CORD-19 dataset, which consists of 2,00,000 journal articles related to coronavirus-related research publications from PubMed's PMC, WHO (World Health Organization), bioRxiv, and medRxiv pre-prints. Along with this document corpus, they have also provided a topics dataset named topics-rnd3 consisting of a list of topics. Each topic has three types of representations like query, question, and narrative. These Datasets are made open for research, and also they released a TREC-COVID competition on Kaggle. Using these topics like queries, our goal is to find out the relevant documents in the CORD-19 dataset. In this research, relevant documents should be recognized for the posed topics in topics-rnd3 data set. The proposed model uses Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques like Bag-of-Words, Average Word-2-Vec, Average BERT Base model and Tf-Idf weighted Word2Vec model to fabricate vectors for query, question, narrative, and combinations of them. Similarly, fabricate vectors for titles in the CORD-19 dataset. After fabricating vectors, cosine similarity is used for finding similarities between every two vectors. Cosine similarity helps us to find relevant documents for the given topic.	1061
Deep Learning-Based Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccination Responses  from Twitter Data	Kazi Nabiul Alam,Md Shakib Khan,Abdur Rab Dhruba,Mohammad Monirujjaman Khan,Jehad F. Al-Amri,Mehedi Masud,Majdi Rawashdeh	2022/08/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12604v1	ArXiv	This COVID-19 pandemic is so dreadful that it leads to severe anxiety, phobias, and complicated feelings or emotions. Even after vaccination against Coronavirus has been initiated, people feelings have become more diverse and complex, and our goal is to understand and unravel their sentiments in this research using some Deep Learning techniques. Social media is currently the best way to express feelings and emotions, and with the help of it, specifically Twitter, one can have a better idea of what is trending and what is going on in people minds. Our motivation for this research is to understand the sentiment of people regarding the vaccination process, and their diverse thoughts regarding this. In this research, the timeline of the collected tweets was from December 21 to July 21, and contained tweets about the most common vaccines available recently from all across the world. The sentiments of people regarding vaccines of all sorts were assessed by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool named Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoner (VADER). By initializing the sentiment polarities into 3 groups (positive, negative and neutral), the overall scenario was visualized here and our findings came out as 33.96% positive, 17.55% negative and 48.49% neutral responses. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) oriented architecture such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM and Bi-LSTM) is used to assess the performance of the predictive models, with LSTM achieving an accuracy of 90.59% and Bi-LSTM achieving an accuracy of 90.83%. Other performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F-1 score, and Confusion matrix were also shown to validate our models and findings more effectively. This study will help everyone understand public opinion on the COVID-19 vaccines and impact the aim of eradicating the Coronavirus from our beautiful world.	1062
COVID-19 Activity Risk Calculator as a Gamified Public Health  Intervention Tool	Shreyasvi Natraj,Malhar Bhide,Nathan Yap,Meng Liu,Agrima Seth,Jonathan Berman,Christin Glorioso	2022/12/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05035v4	ArXiv	"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has impacted over 200 countries leading to hospitalizations and deaths of millions of people. Public health interventions, such as risk estimators, can reduce the spread of pandemics and epidemics through influencing behavior, which impacts risk of exposure and infection. Current publicly available COVID-19 risk estimation tools have had variable effectiveness during the pandemic due to their dependency on rapidly evolving factors such as community transmission levels and variants. There has also been confusion surrounding certain personal protective strategies such as risk reduction by mask-wearing and vaccination. In order to create a simple easy-to-use tool for estimating different individual risks associated with carrying out daily-life activity, we developed COVID-19 Activity Risk Calculator (CovARC). CovARC is a gamified public health intervention as users can ""play with"" how different risks associated with COVID-19 can change depending on several different factors when carrying out routine daily activities. Empowering the public to make informed, data-driven decisions about safely engaging in activities may help to reduce COVID-19 levels in the community. In this study, we demonstrate a streamlined, scalable and accurate COVID-19 risk calculation system. Our study also demonstrates the quantitative impact of vaccination and mask-wearing during periods of high case counts. Validation of this impact could inform and support policy decisions regarding case thresholds for mask mandates, and other public health interventions."	1063
Human movement decisions during Coronavirus Disease 2019	Ryosuke Omori,Koichi Ito,Shunsuke Kanemitsu,Ryusuke Kimura,Yoh Iwasa	2023/04/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14488v2	ArXiv	Modelling host behavioral change in response to epidemics is important to describe disease dynamics and many previous studies proposed mathematical models describing it. Indeed, the epidemic of COVID-19 clearly demonstrated that people changed their activity in response to the epidemic, which subsequently modified the disease dynamics. To predict the behavioral change relevant to the disease dynamics, we need to know the epidemic situation (e.g., the number of reported cases) at the moment of decision to change behavior. However, it is difficult to identify the timing of decision-making. In this study, we analyzed travel accommodation reservation data in four prefectures of Japan to observe decision-making timings and how it responded to the changing epidemic situation during Japan's Coronavirus Disease 2019 (eight waves until February 2023). To this end, we defined 'mobility avoidance index' to indicate people's decision of mobility avoidance and quantified it using the time-series of the accommodation booking/cancellation data. Our analysis revealed semi-quantitative rules for day-to-day decision-making of human mobility under a given epidemic situation. We observed matches of the peak dates of the index and the number of reported cases. Additionally, we found that mobility avoidance index increased/decreased linearly with the logarithmic number of reported cases during the first epidemic wave. This pattern agrees with Weber-Fechner law in psychophysics. We also found that the slope of the mobility avoidance index against the change of the logarithmic number of reported cases were similar among the waves, while the intercept of that was much reduced as the first epidemic wave passed by. It suggests that the people's response became weakened after the first experience, as if the number of reported cases were multiplied by a constant small factor.	1064
Virucidal Efficacy of Laser-Generated Copper Nanoparticle Coatings  Against Model Coronavirus and Herpesvirus	Shahd Bakhet,Rasa Mardosaitė,Mohamed Ahmed Baba,Asta Tamulevičienė,Brigita Abakevičienė,Tomas Klinavičius,Kristupas Dagilis,Simas Račkauskas,Sigitas Tamulevičius,Raimundas Lelešius,Dainius Zienius,Algirdas Šalomskas,Tomas Tamulevičius	2023/07/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02404v1	ArXiv	High-efficiency antiviral surfaces can be effective means to fight against viral diseases such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Copper and copper oxides, as well as their nanoparticles (Cu NPs) and coatings, are among the effective antiviral materials having internal and external biocidal effects on viruses. In this work, stable Cu NP colloids were produced via femtosecond laser ablation of the metal target in water containing sodium citrate. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that the 32 nm mean size nanoparticles are mixtures of mainly metallic copper and copper (I) oxide Cu2O. Polyvinyl butyral was utilized as the binding agent for the spray-coated Cu NPs. The virucidal efficacy of such coatings containing different Cu content ranging from 2.9 at.% to 11.2 at.%. was confirmed against animal-origin coronavirus containing RNA, the agent of avian infectious bronchitis (IBV), and herpesvirus containing DNA, the agent of bovine herpesvirus (BoHV-1) infection. It was demonstrated that after a short time of exposure, the Cu NPs-based coatings do not have a toxic effect on the cell cultures while demonstrating a negative effect on the biological activity of both model viruses that was confirmed by quantification of the viruses via the determination of tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) virus titre and their viral nucleic acids via determination of threshold cycle (Ct) employing real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The assays showed that the decrease in TCID50 virus titre and increase in Ct values correlated with Cu content in Cu NPs-based coatings for both investigated viruses. Contact with coatings decreased IBV and BoHV-1 numbers from 99.42% to 100.00% and from 98.65% to 99.96% respectively. These findings suggest that Cu NPs show inhibitory effects leading to the inactivation of viruses and their nuclei regardless of the presence of a viral envelope.	1065
Analysis and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France	Duccio Fanelli,Francesco Piazza	2020/03/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06031v1	ArXiv	In this note we analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window $22/01-09/03/2020$. A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals.   The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-(confirmed) infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 20$^{\rm th}$ 2020, with a maximum number of confirmed infected individuals of about 16,000.	1066
A Note on Early Epidemiological Analysis of Coronavirus Disease 2019  Outbreak using Crowdsourced Data	Giuseppe Arbia	2020/03/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06207v1	ArXiv	Crowdsourcing data can prove of paramount importance in monitoring and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The recent paper by Sun, Chen and Viboud (2020) is important because it contributes to the understanding of the epidemiology and of the spreading of Covid-19 in a period when most of the epidemic characteristics are still unknown. However, the use of crowdsourcing data raises a number of problems from the statistical point of view which run the risk of invalidating the results and of biasing estimation and hypothesis testing. While the work by Sun, Chen and Viboud (2020) has to be commended, given the importance of the topic for worldwide health security, in this paper we deem important to remark the presence of the possible sources of statistical biases and to point out possible solutions to them	1067
Potential Neutralizing Antibodies Discovered for Novel Corona Virus  Using Machine Learning	Rishikesh Magar,Prakarsh Yadav,Amir Barati Farimani	2020/03/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08447v1	ArXiv	The fast and untraceable virus mutations take lives of thousands of people before the immune system can produce the inhibitory antibody. Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infected and killed thousands of people in the world. Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can inhibit the viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands. In this paper, we devised a machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory synthetic antibodies for Corona virus. We collected 1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and trained an ML model to predict the antibody response. Using graph featurization with variety of ML methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and found 8 stable antibodies that potentially inhibit COVID-19. We combined bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the Corona virus.	1068
COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size	Andrew J. Stier,Marc G. Berman,Luis M. A. Bettencourt	2020/03/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10376v2	ArXiv	The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.	1069
A time series method to analyze incidence pattern and estimate  reproduction number of COVID-19	Soudeep Deb,Manidipa Majumdar	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10655v1	ArXiv	The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019. It has already affected more than 300,000 people, with the number of deaths nearing 13000 across the world. As it has been posing a huge threat to global public health, it is of utmost importance to identify the rate at which the disease is spreading. In this study, we propose a time series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19 outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown, wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. The above statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in. This has the potential to help in prompting policies to address COVID-19 pandemic in different countries.	1070
Diffusion as a First Model of Spread of Viral Infection	Paulo H. Acioli	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11449v2	ArXiv	The appearance of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in late 2019 has dominated the news in the last few months as it developed into a pandemic. In many mathematics and physics classrooms, instructors are using the time series of the number of cases to show exponential growth of the infection. In this manuscript we propose a simple diffusion process as the mode of spreading infections. This model is less sophisticated than other models in the literature, but it can capture the exponential growth and it can explain it in terms of mobility (diffusion constant), population density, and probability of transmission. Students can change the parameters and determine the growth rate and predict the total number of cases as a function of time. Students are also given the opportunity to add other factors that are not considered in the simple diffusion model.	1071
Covid-19: Automatic detection from X-Ray images utilizing Transfer  Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks	Ioannis D. Apostolopoulos,Tzani Bessiana	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11617v1	ArXiv	In this study, a dataset of X-Ray images from patients with common pneumonia, Covid-19, and normal incidents was utilized for the automatic detection of the Coronavirus. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures proposed over recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure called transfer learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The dataset utilized in this experiment is a collection of 1427 X-Ray images. 224 images with confirmed Covid-19, 700 images with confirmed common pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions are included. The data was collected from the available X-Ray images on public medical repositories. With transfer learning, an overall accuracy of 97.82% in the detection of Covid-19 is achieved.	1072
Spatial-Temporal Dataset of COVID-19 Outbreak in China	Wenyuan Liu,Peter Tsung-Wen Yen,Siew Ann Cheong	2020/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11716v2	ArXiv	We present Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) statistics in China dataset: daily statistics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China at the city/county level. For each city/country, we include the six most important numbers for epidemic research: daily new infections, accumulated infections, daily new recoveries, accumulated recoveries, daily new deaths, and accumulated deaths. We cross validate the dataset and the estimate error rate is about 0.04%. We then give several examples to show how to trace the spreading in particular cities or provinces, and also contrast the development of COVID-19 in all cities in China at the early, middle and late stages. We hope this dataset can help researchers around the world better understand the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 at a regional level, to inform intervention and mitigation strategies for policymakers.	1073
Age-structured impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in  India	Rajesh Singh,R. Adhikari	2020/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12055v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. The structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and, in the absence of vaccines, the control of these structures through large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation. Here we use an age-structured SIR model with social contact matrices obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation to study the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. The basic reproductive ratio R0 and its time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data, age distribution and social contact structure. The impact of social distancing measures - workplace non-attendance, school closure, lockdown - and their efficacy with durations are then investigated. A three-week lockdown is found insufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, protocols of sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested. Forecasts are provided for the reduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of these measures. Our study underlines the importance of age and social contact structures in assessing the country-specific impact of mitigatory social distancing.	1074
Effects of social distancing and isolation on epidemic spreading: a  dynamical density functional theory model	Michael te Vrugt,Jens Bickmann,Raphael Wittkowski	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13967v2	ArXiv	For preventing the spread of epidemics such as the coronavirus disease COVID-19, social distancing and the isolation of infected persons are crucial. However, existing reaction-diffusion equations for epidemic spreading are incapable of describing these effects. We present an extended model for disease spread based on combining an SIR model with a dynamical density functional theory where social distancing and isolation of infected persons are explicitly taken into account. The model shows interesting nonequilibrium phase separation associated with a reduction of the number of infections, and allows for new insights into the control of pandemics.	1075
Mobility Changes in Response to COVID-19	Michael S. Warren,Samuel W. Skillman	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14228v1	ArXiv	In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, both voluntary changes in behavior and administrative restrictions on human interactions have occurred. These actions are intended to reduce the transmission rate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We use anonymized and/or de-identified mobile device locations to measure mobility, a statistic representing the distance a typical member of a given population moves in a day. Results indicate that a large reduction in mobility has taken place, both in the US and globally. In the United States, large mobility reductions have been detected associated with the onset of the COVID-19 threat and specific government directives. Mobility data at the US admin1 (state) and admin2 (county) level have been made freely available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0) license via the GitHub repository https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19/	1076
Efficient identification of infected sub-population	Anže Slosar	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14337v1	ArXiv	When testing for infections, the standard method is to test each subject individually. If testing methodology is such that samples from multiple subjects can be efficiently combined and tested at once, yielding a positive results if any one subject in the subgroup is positive, then one can often identify the infected sub-population with a considerably lower number of tests compared to the number of test subjects. We present two such methods that allow an increase in testing efficiency (in terms of total number of test performed) by a factor of $\approx$ 10 if population infection rate is $10^{-2}$ and a factor of $\approx$50 when it is $10^{-3}$. Such methods could be useful when testing large fractions of the total population, as will be perhaps required during the current coronavirus pandemic.	1077
Data-Driven Modeling Reveals the Impact of Stay-at-Home Orders on Human  Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the U.S	Chenfeng Xiong,Songhua Hu,Mofeng Yang,Hannah N Younes,Weiyu Luo,Sepehr Ghader,Lei Zhang	2020/05/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00667v2	ArXiv	One approach to delay the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is to reduce human travel by imposing travel restriction policies. It is yet unclear how effective those policies are on suppressing the mobility trend due to the lack of ground truth and large-scale dataset describing human mobility during the pandemic. This study uses real-world location-based service data collected from anonymized mobile devices to uncover mobility changes during COVID-19 and under the 'Stay-at-home' state orders in the U.S. The study measures human mobility with two important metrics: daily average number of trips per person and daily average person-miles traveled. The data-driven analysis and modeling attribute less than 5% of the reduction in the number of trips and person-miles traveled to the effect of the policy. The models developed in the study exhibit high prediction accuracy and can be applied to inform epidemics modeling with empirically verified mobility trends and to support time-sensitive decision-making processes.	1078
Transcriptional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infection dismantles pathogenic  pathways activated by the virus, proposes unique sex-specific differences and  predicts tailored therapeutic strategies	Paolo Fagone,Rosella Ciurleo,Salvo Danilo Lombardo,Carmelo Iacobello,Concetta Ilenia Palermo,Yehuda Shoenfeld,Klaus Bendtzen,Placido Bramanti,Ferdinando Nicoletti	2020/05/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01042v1	ArXiv	The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global health. As no specific therapeutics are yet available to control disease evolution, more in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 will help to characterize new targets for the management of COVID-19. The present study identified a specific set of biological pathways altered in primary human lung epithelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a comparison with SARS-CoV from the 2003 pandemic was studied. The transcriptomic profiles were also exploited as possible novel therapeutic targets, and anti-signature perturbation analysis predicted potential drugs to control disease progression. Among them, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B Kinase (IKK) inhibitors emerged as candidate drugs. Finally, sex-specific differences that may underlie the higher COVID-19 mortality in men are proposed.	1079
Modeling the Epidemic Outbreak and Dynamics of COVID-19 in Croatia	Ante Lojić Kapetanović,Dragan Poljak	2020/05/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01434v1	ArXiv	The paper deals with a modeling of the ongoing epidemic caused by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the closed territory of the Republic of Croatia. Using the official public information on the number of confirmed infected, recovered and deceased individuals, the modified SEIR compartmental model is developed to describe the underlying dynamics of the epidemic. Fitted modified SEIR model provides the prediction of the disease progression in the near future, considering strict control interventions by means of social distancing and quarantine for infected and at-risk individuals introduced at the beginning of COVID-19 spread on February, 25th by Croatian Ministry of Health. Assuming the accuracy of provided data and satisfactory representativeness of the model used, the basic reproduction number is derived. Obtained results portray potential positive developments and justify the stringent precautionary measures introduced by the Ministry of Health.	1080
SLEDGE: A Simple Yet Effective Baseline for COVID-19 Scientific  Knowledge Search	Sean MacAvaney,Arman Cohan,Nazli Goharian	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02365v3	ArXiv	With worldwide concerns surrounding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a rapidly growing body of literature on the virus. Clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers need a way to effectively search these articles. In this work, we present a search system called SLEDGE, which utilizes SciBERT to effectively re-rank articles. We train the model on a general-domain answer ranking dataset, and transfer the relevance signals to SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation. We observe SLEDGE's effectiveness as a strong baseline on the TREC-COVID challenge (topping the learderboard with an nDCG@10 of 0.6844). Insights provided by a detailed analysis provide some potential future directions to explore, including the importance of filtering by date and the potential of neural methods that rely more heavily on count signals. We release the code to facilitate future work on this critical task at https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/covid-neural-ir	1081
Evolutionary Multi-Objective Design of SARS-CoV-2 Protease Inhibitor  Candidates	Tim Cofala,Lars Elend,Philip Mirbach,Jonas Prellberg,Thomas Teusch,Oliver Kramer	2020/05/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02666v2	ArXiv	Computational drug design based on artificial intelligence is an emerging research area. At the time of writing this paper, the world suffers from an outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. A promising way to stop the virus replication is via protease inhibition. We propose an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (EMOA) to design potential protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2's main protease. Based on the SELFIES representation the EMOA maximizes the binding of candidate ligands to the protein using the docking tool QuickVina 2, while at the same time taking into account further objectives like drug-likeliness or the fulfillment of filter constraints. The experimental part analyzes the evolutionary process and discusses the inhibitor candidates.	1082
Estimation of the actual disease occurrence based on official case  numbers during a COVID outbreak in Germany 2020	Ralph Brinks,Annika Hoyer	2020/05/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03408v1	ArXiv	Since the beginning of March 2020, the cumulative numbers of cases of infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Germany have been reported on a daily basis. The reports originate from national laws, according to which positive test findings must be submitted to the Federal Health Authorities, the Robert Koch Institute, via the local health authorities. Since an enormous number of unreported cases can be expected, the question of how widespread the disease has been in the population cannot be answered based on these administrative reports. Using mathematical modeling, however, estimates can be made. These estimates indicate that the small numbers of diagnostic tests carried out at the beginning of the outbreak overlooked considerable parts of the infection. In order to cover the initial phase of future waves of the disease, wide-spread and comprehensive tests are recommended.	1083
COVID-19 Contact-tracing Apps: a Survey on the Global Deployment and  Challenges	Jinfeng Li,Xinyi Guo	2020/05/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03599v2	ArXiv	To address the massive spike in uncertainties triggered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), there is an ever-increasing number of national governments that are rolling out contact-tracing Apps to aid the containment of the virus. The first hugely contentious issue facing the Apps is the deployment framework, i.e. centralized or decentralized. Based on this, the debate branches out to the corresponding technologies that underpin these architectures, i.e. GPS, QR codes, and Bluetooth. This work conducts a pioneering review of the above scenarios and contributes a geolocation mapping of the current deployment. The Apps vulnerabilities and the directions of research are identified, with a special focus on the Bluetooth-inspired decentralized paradigm.	1084
RetinaFaceMask: A Single Stage Face Mask Detector for Assisting Control  of the COVID-19 Pandemic	Xinqi Fan,Mingjie Jiang	2020/05/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03950v3	ArXiv	Coronavirus 2019 has made a significant impact on the world. One effective strategy to prevent infection for people is to wear masks in public places. Certain public service providers require clients to use their services only if they properly wear masks. There are, however, only a few research studies on automatic face mask detection. In this paper, we proposed RetinaFaceMask, the first high-performance single stage face mask detector. First, to solve the issue that existing studies did not distinguish between correct and incorrect mask wearing states, we established a new dataset containing these annotations. Second, we proposed a context attention module to focus on learning discriminated features associated with face mask wearing states. Third, we transferred the knowledge from the face detection task, inspired by how humans improve their ability via learning from similar tasks. Ablation studies showed the advantages of the proposed model. Experimental findings on both the public and new datasets demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our model.	1085
COVID-19 growth prediction using multivariate long short term memory	Novanto Yudistira	2020/05/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04809v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread forecasting is an important task to track the growth of the pandemic. Existing predictions are merely based on qualitative analyses and mathematical modeling. The use of available big data with machine learning is still limited in COVID-19 growth prediction even though the availability of data is abundance. To make use of big data in the prediction using deep learning, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to learn the correlation of COVID-19 growth over time. The structure of an LSTM layer is searched heuristically until the best validation score is achieved. First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the globe. We achieved favorable performance compared with that of the recurrent neural network (RNN) method with a comparable low validation error. The evaluation is conducted based on graph visualization and root mean squared error (RMSE). We found that it is not easy to achieve the same quantity of confirmed cases over time. However, LSTM provide a similar pattern between the actual cases and prediction. In the future, our proposed prediction can be used for anticipating forthcoming pandemics. The code is provided here: https://github.com/cbasemaster/lstmcorona	1086
Digit analysis for Covid-19 reported data	Jean-François Coeurjolly	2020/05/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05009v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus which appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan has spread out worldwide and caused the death of more than 280,000 people (as of May, 11 2020). Since February 2020, doubts were raised about the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths reported by the Chinese government. In this paper, we examine data available from China at the city and provincial levels and we compare them with Canadian provincial data, US state data and French regional data. We consider cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths and examine these numbers through the lens of their first two digits and in particular we measure departures of these first two digits to the Newcomb-Benford distribution, often used to detect frauds. Our finding is that there is no evidence that cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths for all these countries have different first or second digit distributions. We also show that the Newcomb-Benford distribution cannot be rejected for these data.	1087
The First French COVID19 Lockdown Twitter Dataset	Sophie Balech,Christophe Benavent,Mihai Calciu	2020/05/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05075v1	ArXiv	In this paper, we present a mainly French coronavirus Twitter dataset that we have been continuously collecting since lockdown restrictions have been enacted in France (in March 17, 2020). We offer our datasets and sentiment analysis annotations to the research community at https://github.com/calciu/COVID19-LockdownFr. They have been obtained using high performance computing (HPC) capabilities of our university's datacenter. We think that our contribution can facilitate analysis of online conversation dynamics reflecting people sentiments when facing severe home confinement restrictions determined by the outbreak of this world wide epidemic. We hope that our contribution will help decode shared experience and mood but also test the sensitivity of sentiment measurement instruments and incite the development of new instruments, methods and approaches.	1088
A numerical simulation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina using the  SEIR model	Juan E. Santos,Jose' M. Carcione,Gabriela B. Savioli,Patricia M. Gauzellino,Alejandro Ravecca,Alfredo Moras	2020/05/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06297v4	ArXiv	A pandemic caused by a new coronavirus has spread worldwide, affecting Argentina. We implement an SEIR model to analyze the disease evolution in Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities. The model parameters are calibrated using the number of casualties officially reported. Since infinite solutions honour the data, we show different cases. In all of them the reproduction ratio $R_0$ decreases after early lockdown, but then raises, probably due to an increase in contagion in highly populated slums. Therefore it is mandatory to reverse this growing trend in $R_0$ by applying control strategies to avoid a high number of infectious and dead individuals. The model provides an effective procedure to estimate epidemic parameters (fatality rate, transmission probability, infection and incubation periods) and monitor control measures during the epidemic evolution.	1089
Global analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using simple epidemiological  models	J. E. Amaro,J. Dudouet,J. N. Orce	2020/05/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06742v1	ArXiv	Several analytical models have been used in this work to describe the evolution of death cases arising from coronavirus (COVID-19). The Death or `D' model is a simplified version of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, which assumes no recovery over time, and allows for the transmission-dynamics equations to be solved analytically. The D-model can be extended to describe various focuses of infection, which may account for the original pandemic (D1), the lockdown (D2) and other effects (Dn). The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries (China, Spain, Italy, France, UK, Iran, USA and Germany) shows a similar behavior in concord with the D-model trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow decline, which are affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown effect. These results are in agreement with more accurate calculations using the extended SIR model with a parametrized solution and more sophisticated Monte Carlo grid simulations, which predict similar trends and indicate a common evolution of the pandemic with universal parameters.	1090
Using Bayesian Optimization to Accelerate Virtual Screening for the  Discovery of Therapeutics Appropriate for Repurposing for COVID-19	Edward O. Pyzer-Knapp	2020/05/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07121v1	ArXiv	The novel Wuhan coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has brought almost unprecedented effects for a non-wartime setting, hitting social, economic and health systems hard.~ Being able to bring to bear pharmaceutical interventions to counteract its effects will represent a major turning point in the fight to turn the tides in this ongoing battle.~ Recently, the World's most powerful supercomputer, SUMMIT, was used to identify existing small molecule pharmaceuticals which may have the desired activity against SARS-CoV-2 through a high throughput virtual screening approach. In this communication, we demonstrate how the use of Bayesian optimization can provide a valuable service for the prioritisation of these calculations, leading to the accelerated identification of high-performing candidates, and thus expanding the scope of the utility of HPC systems for time critical screening	1091
Assessing the impacts of mutations to the structure of COVID-19 spike  protein via sequential Monte Carlo	Samuel W. K. Wong	2020/05/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07550v2	ArXiv	Proteins play a key role in facilitating the infectiousness of the 2019 novel coronavirus. A specific spike protein enables this virus to bind to human cells, and a thorough understanding of its 3-dimensional structure is therefore critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions. However, its structure may continue to evolve over time as a result of mutations. In this paper, we use a data science perspective to study the potential structural impacts due to ongoing mutations in its amino acid sequence. To do so, we identify a key segment of the protein and apply a sequential Monte Carlo sampling method to detect possible changes to the space of low-energy conformations for different amino acid sequences. Such computational approaches can further our understanding of this protein structure and complement laboratory efforts.	1092
Identification of Repurposable Drugs and Adverse Drug Reactions for  Various Courses of COVID-19 Based on Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data	Zhihan Wang,Kai Guo,Pan Gao,Qinqin Pu,Min Wu,Changlong Li,Junguk Hur	2020/05/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07856v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted almost every part of human life worldwide, posing a massive threat to human health. There is no specific drug for COVID-19, highlighting the urgent need for the development of effective therapeutics. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA-approved drugs and preclinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression perturbation data for chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures project with a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We identified 281 FDA-approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 16 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. We experimentally tested the inhibitory effects of tyrphostin-AG-1478 and brefeldin-a on the replication of the single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) virus influenza A virus. In conclusion, we have identified a list of repurposable anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs using a systems biology approach.	1093
#Coronavirus or #Chinesevirus?!: Understanding the negative sentiment  reflected in Tweets with racist hashtags across the development of COVID-19	Xin Pei,Deval Mehta	2020/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08224v1	ArXiv	Situated in the global outbreak of COVID-19, our study enriches the discussion concerning the emergent racism and xenophobia on social media. With big data extracted from Twitter, we focus on the analysis of negative sentiment reflected in tweets marked with racist hashtags, as racism and xenophobia are more likely to be delivered via the negative sentiment. Especially, we propose a stage-based approach to capture how the negative sentiment changes along with the three development stages of COVID-19, under which it transformed from a domestic epidemic into an international public health emergency and later, into the global pandemic. At each stage, sentiment analysis enables us to recognize the negative sentiment from tweets with racist hashtags, and keyword extraction allows for the discovery of themes in the expression of negative sentiment by these tweets. Under this public health crisis of human beings, this stage-based approach enables us to provide policy suggestions for the enactment of stage-specific intervention strategies to combat racism and xenophobia on social media in a more effective way.	1094
Dynamical modelling and analysis of COVID-19 in India	R. Gopal,V. K. Chandrasekar,M. Lakshmanan	2020/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08255v3	ArXiv	We consider the pandemic spreading of COVID-19 in India after the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan city, China. We estimate the transmission rate of the initial infecting individuals of COVID-19 in India by using the officially reported data at the early stage of the epidemic with the help of Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Removed (R) population model, the so-called SEIR dynamical model. Numerical analysis and model verification are performed to calibrate the system parameters with official public information about the number of people infected, and then to evaluate several COVID -19 scenarios potentially applicable to India. Our findings provide an estimation of disease occurrence in the near future and also demonstrate the importance of governmental and individual efforts to control the effects and time of the pandemic-related critical situations. We also give special emphasis to individual reactions in the containment process.	1095
An Overview on Audio, Signal, Speech, & Language Processing for COVID-19	Gauri Deshpande,Björn Schuller	2020/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08579v1	ArXiv	Recently, there has been an increased attention towards innovating, enhancing, building, and deploying applications of speech signal processing for providing assistance and relief to human mankind from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Many AI with speech initiatives are taken to combat with the present situation and also to create a safe and secure environment for the future. This paper summarises all these efforts taken by the re-search community towards helping the individuals and the society in the fight against COVID-19 over the past 3-4 months using speech signal processing. We also summarise the deep techniques used in this direction to come up with capable solutions in a short span of time. This paper further gives an overview of the contributions from non-speech modalities that may complement or serve as inspiration for audio and speech analysis. In addition, we discuss our observations with respect to solution usability, challenges, and the significant technology achievements.	1096
A country comparison of place-based activity response to COVID-19  policies	Grant McKenzie,Benjamin Adams	2020/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08738v1	ArXiv	The emergence of the novel Coronavirus Disease in late 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent pandemic led to an immense disruption in the daily lives of almost everyone on the planet. Faced with the consequences of inaction, most national governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by their inhabitants. As schools and businesses shuttered, the mobility of these people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns emerged that varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations, specifically focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns. We show that people's activity response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within them. Three assessment measures are devised and the results correlate with a number of global indices. We discuss these findings and the relationship between government action and residents' response.	1097
Inbetweening auto-animation via Fokker-Planck dynamics and thresholding	Yuan Gao,Guangzhen Jin,Jian-Guo Liu	2020/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08858v1	ArXiv	We propose an equilibrium-driven deformation algorithm (EDDA) to simulate the inbetweening transformations starting from an initial image to an equilibrium image, which covers images varying from a greyscale type to a colorful type on plane or manifold. The algorithm is based on Fokker-Planck dynamics on manifold, which automatically cooperates positivity, unconditional stability, mass conservation law, exponentially convergence and also the manifold structure suggested by dataset. The thresholding scheme is adapted for the sharp interface dynamics and is used to achieve the finite time convergence. Using EDDA, three challenging examples, (I) facial aging process, (II) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) invading/treatment process, and (III) continental evolution process are conducted efficiently.	1098
Letter to the Editor: Note on published research on the effects of  COVID-19 on the environment without sufficient depth of science	Ahmed Mustafa,Timon McPhearson	2020/05/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10303v4	ArXiv	Dear Editor-in-Chief: We have given two articles published recently in Science of the Total Environment by Mandal and Pal (2020) and Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020) a thorough reading. Both articles present a significant association between the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) social distancing policies and improvement in environmental quality such as air pollution, land surface temperature, and noise. Both articles present good research, complemented by detailed explanations and displays, yet we have a few concerns that affect the interpretation and meaning of the results.	1099
Towards Seamless Authentication for Zoom-Based Online Teaching and  Meeting	Manoranjan Mohanty,Waheeb Yaqub	2020/05/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10553v1	ArXiv	The lockdowns and travel restrictions in current coronavirus pandemic situation has replaced face-to-face teaching and meeting with online teaching and meeting. Recently, the video conferencing tool Zoom has become extremely popular for its simple-to-use feature and low network bandwith requirement. However, Zoom has serious security and privacy issues. Due to weak authentication mechanisms, unauthorized persons are invading Zoom sessions and creating disturbances (known as Zoom bombing). In this paper, we propose a preliminary work towards a seamless authentication mechanism for Zoom-based teaching and meeting. Our method is based on PRNU (Photo Response Non Uniformity)-based camera authentication, which can authenticate the camera of a device used in a Zoom meeting without requiring any assistance from the participants (e.g., needing the participant to provide biometric). Results from a small-scale experiment validates the proposed method.	1100
CovidChain: An Anonymity Preserving Blockchain Based Framework for  Protection Against Covid-19	Hiten Choudhury,Bidisha Goswami,Sameer Kumar Gurung	2020/05/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10607v1	ArXiv	Today, the entire world is facing incredible health and economic challenges due to the rapid spread of the life threatening novel Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19). In the prevailing situation when a vaccine is many months away, the way forward seems to be a controlled exit from the lockdown - where, infected/exposed people are strictly quarantined and recovered/unexposed people are allowed to carry on with their day to day business activities. However, appropriate physical distancing norms will have to be strictly followed for such relaxations. Therefore, mechanisms are required that will assist people in following the social and physical distancing norms in public places. In this paper, we propose an anonymity preserving blockchain based framework that allows people, through use of their smart phones and other communication devices, to protect themselves from infections as they conduct their daily business activities.	1101
Likelihood of survival of coronavirus in a respiratory droplet deposited  on a solid surface	Rajneesh Bhardwaj,Amit Agrawal	2020/05/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10897v1	ArXiv	We predict and analyze the drying time of respiratory droplets from a COVID-19 infected subject, which is a crucial time to infect another subject. The drying of the droplet is predicted by diffusion-limited evaporation model for a sessile droplet placed on a partially-wetted surface with a pinned contact line. The variation of droplet volume, contact angle, ambient temperature, and humidity are considered. We analyze the chances of the survival of the viruses present in the droplet, based on the lifetime of the droplets in several conditions, and find that the chances of survival of the virus are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear stress inside the droplet computed using the model is not large enough to obliterate the virus. We also explore the relationship between the drying time of a droplet and the growth rate of the spread of COVID-19 for five different cities, and find that they are weakly correlated.	1102
Challenges in Combating COVID-19 Infodemic -- Data, Tools, and Ethics	Kaize Ding,Kai Shu,Yichuan Li,Amrita Bhattacharjee,Huan Liu	2020/05/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13691v1	ArXiv	While the COVID-19 pandemic continues its global devastation, numerous accompanying challenges emerge. One important challenge we face is to efficiently and effectively use recently gathered data and find computational tools to combat the COVID-19 infodemic, a typical information overloading problem. Novel coronavirus presents many questions without ready answers; its uncertainty and our eagerness in search of solutions offer a fertile environment for infodemic. It is thus necessary to combat the infodemic and make a concerted effort to confront COVID-19 and mitigate its negative impact in all walks of life when saving lives and maintaining normal orders during trying times. In this position paper of combating the COVID-19 infodemic, we illustrate its need by providing real-world examples of rampant conspiracy theories, misinformation, and various types of scams that take advantage of human kindness, fear, and ignorance. We present three key challenges in this fight against the COVID-19 infodemic where researchers and practitioners instinctively want to contribute and help. We demonstrate that these three challenges can and will be effectively addressed by collective wisdom, crowdsourcing, and collaborative research.	1103
A Data-Driven Network Model for the Emerging COVID-19 Epidemics in  Wuhan, Toronto and Italy	Ling Xue,Shuanglin Jing,Joel C. Miller,Wei Sun,Huafeng Li,Jose Guillermo Estrada-Franco,James M Hyman,Huaiping Zhu	2020/05/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14533v1	ArXiv	The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens the health of humans and causes great economic losses. Predictive modelling and forecasting the epidemic trends are essential for developing countermeasures to mitigate this pandemic. We develop a network model, where each node represents an individual and the edges represent contacts between individuals where the infection can spread. The individuals are classified based on the number of contacts they have each day (their node degrees) and their infection status. The transmission network model was respectively fitted to the reported data for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan (China), Toronto (Canada), and the Italian Republic using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimization algorithm. Our model fits all three regions well with narrow confidence intervals and could be adapted to simulate other megacities or regions. The model projections on the role of containment strategies can help inform public health authorities to plan control measures.	1104
Performance analysis of Zero Black-Derman-Toy interest rate model in  catastrophic events: COVID-19 case study	Grzegorz Krzyżanowski,Andrés Sosa	2020/07/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00705v2	ArXiv	In this paper we continue the research of our recent interest rate tree model called Zero Black-Derman-Toy (ZBDT) model, which includes the possibility of a jump at each step to a practically zero interest rate. This approach allows to better match to risk of financial slowdown caused by catastrophic events. We present how to valuate a wide range of financial derivatives for such a model. The classical Black-Derman-Toy (BDT) model and novel ZBDT model are described and analogies in their calibration methodology are established. Finally two cases of applications of the novel ZBDT model are introduced. The first of them is the hypothetical case of an S-shape term structure and decreasing volatility of yields. The second case is an application of the ZBDT model in the structure of United States sovereign bonds in the current $2020$ economic slowdown caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. The objective of this study is to understand the differences presented by the valuation in both models for different derivatives.	1105
Liaison, safeguard, and well-being: analyzing the role of social robots  during the COVID-19 pandemic	Laura Aymerich-Franch,Iliana Ferrer	2020/07/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03941v4	ArXiv	We examine the implementation of social robots in real-world settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we analyze the areas in which social robots are being adopted, the roles and tasks being fulfilled, and the robot models being implemented. For this, we traced back and analyzed 240 deployment cases with 86 different social robots worldwide that have been adopted since the coronavirus outbreak. We found that social robot adoption during this period was strongly related to the use of this technology for crisis management. The social robots' capacity to perform the roles of liaison to minimize direct contact among humans, safeguard to ensure contagion risk-free environments, and well-being coach to protect mental and physical health, is key to explaining adoption within this context. The results of the study offer a complete overview of social robots' utilization in real life settings during the pandemic.	1106
Fixed-time descriptive statistics underestimate extremes of epidemic  curve ensembles	Jonas L. Juul,Kaare Græsbøll,Lasse Engbo Christiansen,Sune Lehmann	2020/07/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05035v1	ArXiv	Across the world, scholars are racing to predict the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. Such predictions are often pursued by numerically simulating epidemics with a large number of plausible combinations of relevant parameters. It is essential that any forecast of the epidemic trajectory derived from the resulting ensemble of simulated curves is presented with confidence intervals that communicate the uncertainty associated with the forecast. Here we argue that the state-of-the-art approach for summarizing ensemble statistics does not capture crucial epidemiological information. In particular, the current approach systematically suppresses information about the projected trajectory peaks. The fundamental problem is that each time step is treated separately in the statistical analysis. We suggest using curve-based descriptive statistics to summarize trajectory ensembles. The results presented allow researchers to report more representative confidence intervals, resulting in more realistic projections of epidemic trajectories and -- in turn -- enable better decision making in the face of the current and future pandemics.	1107
Predication of Inflection Point and Outbreak Size of COVID-19 in New  Epicentres	Qibin Duan,Jinran Wu,Gaojun Wu,You-Gan Wang	2020/07/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07471v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had caused more that 8 million infections as of middle June 2020. Recently, Brazil has become a new epicentre of COVID-19, while India and African region are potential epicentres. This study aims to predict the inflection point and outbreak size of these new/potential epicentres at the early phase of the epidemics by borrowing information from more `mature' curves from other countries. We modeled the cumulative cases to the well-known sigmoid growth curves to describe the epidemic trends under the mixed-effect models and using the four-parameter logistic model after power transformations. African region is predicted to have the largest total outbreak size of 3.9 million cases (2.2 to 6 million), and the inflection will come around September 13, 2020. Brazil and India are predicted to have a similar final outbreak size of around 2.5 million cases (1.1 to 4.3 million), with the inflection points arriving June 23 and July 26, respectively. We conclude in Brazil, India, and African the epidemics of COVI19 have not yet passed the inflection points; these regions potentially can take over USA in terms of outbreak size	1108
Heterogeneity Learning for SIRS model: an Application to the COVID-19	Guanyu Hu,Junxian Geng	2020/07/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08047v1	ArXiv	We propose a Bayesian Heterogeneity Learning approach for Susceptible-Infected-Removal-Susceptible (SIRS) model that allows underlying clustering patterns for transmission rate, recovery rate, and loss of immunity rate for the latest coronavirus (COVID-19) among different regions. Our proposed method provides simultaneously inference on parameter estimation and clustering information which contains both number of clusters and cluster configurations. Specifically, our key idea is to formulates the SIRS model into a hierarchical form and assign the Mixture of Finite mixtures priors for heterogeneity learning. The properties of the proposed models are examined and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is used to sample from the posterior distribution. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to examine empirical performance of the proposed methods. We further apply the proposed methodology to analyze the state level COVID-19 data in U.S.	1109
A Recurrent Neural Network and Differential Equation Based  Spatiotemporal Infectious Disease Model with Application to COVID-19	Zhijian Li,Yunling Zheng,Jack Xin,Guofa Zhou	2020/07/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10929v2	ArXiv	The outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have impacted the world significantly. Modeling the trend of infection and real-time forecasting of cases can help decision making and control of the disease spread. However, data-driven methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) can perform poorly due to limited daily samples in time. In this work, we develop an integrated spatiotemporal model based on the epidemic differential equations (SIR) and RNN. The former after simplification and discretization is a compact model of temporal infection trend of a region while the latter models the effect of nearest neighboring regions. The latter captures latent spatial information. %that is not publicly reported. We trained and tested our model on COVID-19 data in Italy, and show that it out-performs existing temporal models (fully connected NN, SIR, ARIMA) in 1-day, 3-day, and 1-week ahead forecasting especially in the regime of limited training data.	1110
Darwin's Neural Network: AI-based Strategies for Rapid and Scalable Cell  and Coronavirus Screening	Sang Won Lee,Yueh-Ting Chiu,Philip Brudnicki,Audrey M. Bischoff,Angus Jelinek,Jenny Zijun Wang,Danielle R. Bogdanowicz,Andrew F. Laine,Jia Guo,Helen H. Lu	2020/07/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11653v1	ArXiv	Recent advances in the interdisciplinary scientific field of machine perception, computer vision, and biomedical engineering underpin a collection of machine learning algorithms with a remarkable ability to decipher the contents of microscope and nanoscope images. Machine learning algorithms are transforming the interpretation and analysis of microscope and nanoscope imaging data through use in conjunction with biological imaging modalities. These advances are enabling researchers to carry out real-time experiments that were previously thought to be computationally impossible. Here we adapt the theory of survival of the fittest in the field of computer vision and machine perception to introduce a new framework of multi-class instance segmentation deep learning, Darwin's Neural Network (DNN), to carry out morphometric analysis and classification of COVID19 and MERS-CoV collected in vivo and of multiple mammalian cell types in vitro.	1111
An agent-based model for interrelation between COVID-19 outbreak and  economic activities	Takeshi Kano,Kotaro Yasui,Taishi Mikami,Munehiro Asally,Akio Ishiguro	2020/07/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11988v1	ArXiv	As of July, 2020, acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus COVID-19 is spreading over the world and causing severe economic damages. While minimizing human contact is effective in managing the outbreak, it causes severe economic losses. Strategies solving this dilemma by considering interrelation between the spread of the virus and economic activities are in urgent needs for mitigating the health and economic damage. Here we propose an abstract agent-based model for the outbreak of COVID-19 in which economic activities are taken into account. The computational simulation of the model recapitulated the trade-off between health and economic damage associated with lockdown measures. Based on the simulation results, we discuss how macroscopic dynamics of infection and economy emerge from the individuals' behaviours. We believe our model can serve as a platform for discussing solutions to the abovementioned dilemma.	1112
IoT meets COVID-19: Status, Challenges, and Opportunities	Mohsin Kamal,Abdulah Aljohani,Eisa Alanazi	2020/06/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12268v1	ArXiv	Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to utilize existing technologies to their full potential. Internet of Things (IoT) is regarded as one of the most trending technologies with a great potential in fighting against the coronavirus outbreak. The IoT comprises of a scarce network in which the IoT devices sense the environment and send useful data on the Internet. In this paper, we examine the current status of IoT applications related to COVID-19, identify their deployment and operational challenges, and suggest possible opportunities to further contain the pandemic. Furthermore, we perform analysis for implementing IoT in which internal and external factors are discussed.	1113
Statistical dynamics of social distancing in SARS-CoV-2 as a  differential game	Chris von Csefalvay	2020/07/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13734v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly emerged as a significant threat to global public health, in particular because -- as is not uncommon with novel pathogens -- there is no effective pharmaceutical treatment or prophylaxis to the viral syndrome it causes. In the absence of such specific treatment modalities, the mainstay of public health response rests on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing. This paper contributes to the understanding of social distancing against SARS-CoV-2 by quantitatively analysing the statistical dynamics of disease propagation as a differential game, and estimating the relative costs of distancing versus not distancing, identifying marginal utility of distancing based on known population epidemiological data about SARS-CoV-2 and concluding that unless the costs of distancing vastly exceed the cost of illness per unit time, social distancing remains a dominant strategy. These findings can assist in solidly anchoring public health responses based on social distancing within a quantitative framework attesting to their effectiveness.	1114
Intelligent Optimization of Diversified Community Prevention of COVID-19  using Traditional Chinese Medicine	Yu-Jun Zheng,Si-Lan Yu,Jun-Chao Yang,Tie-Er Gan,Qin Song,Jun Yang,Mumtaz Karatas	2020/07/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13926v1	ArXiv	"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and community prevention has become the most essential part in reducing the spread risk and protecting populations. However, most communities use a uniform TCM prevention program for all residents, which violates the ""treatment based on syndrome differentiation"" principle of TCM and limits the effectiveness of prevention. In this paper, we propose an intelligent optimization method to develop diversified TCM prevention programs for community residents. First, we use a fuzzy clustering method to divide the population based on both modern medicine and TCM health characteristics; we then use an interactive optimization method, in which TCM experts develop different TCM prevention programs for different clusters, and a heuristic algorithm is used to optimize the programs under the resource constraints. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed method and report its successful application to TCM-based prevention of COVID-19 in 12 communities in Zhejiang province, China, during the peak of the pandemic."	1115
Epidemic response to physical distancing policies and their impact on  the outbreak risk	Fabio Vanni,David Lambert,Luigi Palatella	2020/07/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14620v2	ArXiv	We introduce a theoretical framework that highlights the impact of physical distancing variables such as human mobility and physical proximity on the evolution of epidemics and, crucially, on the reproduction number. In particular, in response to the coronavirus disease (CoViD-19) pandemic, countries have introduced various levels of 'lockdown' to reduce the number of new infections. Specifically we use a collisional approach to an infection-age structured model described by a renewal equation for the time homogeneous evolution of epidemics. As a result, we show how various contributions of the lockdown policies, namely physical proximity and human mobility, reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate the risk of disease resurgence. We check our theoretical framework using real-world data on physical distancing with two different data repositories, obtaining consistent results. Finally, we propose an equation for the effective reproduction number which takes into account types of interactions among people, which may help policy makers to improve remote-working organizational structure.	1116
Antiviral Drug-Membrane Permeability: the Viral Envelope and Cellular  Organelles	Changjiang Liu,Paolo Elvati,Angela Violi	2020/07/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14965v1	ArXiv	To shorten the time required to find effective new drugs, like antivirals, a key parameter to consider is membrane permeability, as a compound intended for an intracellular target with poor permeability will have low efficacy. Here, we present a computational model that considers both drug characteristics and membrane properties for the rapid assessment of drugs permeability through the coronavirus envelope and various cellular membranes. We analyze 79 drugs that are considered as potential candidates for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and determine their time of permeation in different organelle membranes grouped by viral baits and mammalian processes. The computational results are correlated with experimental data, present in the literature, on bioavailability of the drugs, showing a negative correlation between fast permeation and most promising drugs. This model represents an important tool capable of evaluating how permeability affects the ability of compounds to reach both intended and unintended intracellular targets in an accurate and rapid way. The method is general and flexible and can be employed for a variety of molecules, from small drugs to nanoparticles, as well to a variety of biological membranes.	1117
Genetic Improvement @ ICSE 2020	William B. Langdon,Westley Weimer,Justyna Petke,Erik Fredericks,Seongmin Lee,Emily Winter,Michail Basios,Myra B. Cohen,Aymeric Blot,Markus Wagner,Bobby R. Bruce,Shin Yoo,Simos Gerasimou,Oliver Krauss,Yu Huang,Michael Gerten	2020/07/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15987v1	ArXiv	Following Prof. Mark Harman of Facebook's keynote and formal presentations (which are recorded in the proceedings) there was a wide ranging discussion at the eighth international Genetic Improvement workshop, GI-2020 @ ICSE (held as part of the 42nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering on Friday 3rd July 2020). Topics included industry take up, human factors, explainabiloity (explainability, justifyability, exploitability) and GI benchmarks. We also contrast various recent online approaches (e.g. SBST 2020) to holding virtual computer science conferences and workshops via the WWW on the Internet without face-2-face interaction. Finally we speculate on how the Coronavirus Covid-19 Pandemic will affect research next year and into the future.	1118
Analytical approach to solve the problem of aircraft passenger boarding  during the coronavirus pandemic	Michael Schultz,Majid Soolaki	2020/07/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16021v1	ArXiv	We design an optimal group boarding method using a stochastic cellular automata model for passenger movements, which is extended by a virus transmission approach. Furthermore, a new mathematical model is developed to determine an appropriate seat layout for groups. The proposed seating layout is based on the idea that group members are allowed to have close contact and that groups should have a distance among each other. The sum of individual transmission rates is taken as the objective function to derive scenarios with a low level transmission risk. After the determination of an appropriate seat layout, the cellular automata is used to derive and evaluate a corresponding boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. We find that the consideration of groups in a pandemic scenario will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about 60%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85%), which reaches the level of boarding times in pre-pandemic scenarios.	1119
covid19.analytics: An R Package to Obtain, Analyze and Visualize Data  from the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic	Marcelo Ponce,Amit Sandhel	2020/09/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01091v2	ArXiv	"With the emergence of a new pandemic worldwide, a novel strategy to approach it has emerged. Several initiatives under the umbrella of ""open science"" are contributing to tackle this unprecedented situation. In particular, the ""R Language and Environment for Statistical Computing"" offers an excellent tool and ecosystem for approaches focusing on open science and reproducible results. Hence it is not surprising that with the onset of the pandemic, a large number of R packages and resources were made available for researches working in the pandemic. In this paper, we present an R package that allows users to access and analyze worldwide data from resources publicly available. We will introduce the covid19.analytics package, focusing in its capabilities and presenting a particular study case where we describe how to deploy the ""COVID19.ANALYTICS Dashboard Explorer""."	1120
Assess the impacts of human mobility change on COVID-19 dynamics in  Arizona, U.S.: a modeling study incorporating Google Community Mobility  Reports	Nao Yamamoto,Haiyan Wang	2020/09/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02419v1	ArXiv	In June 2020, Arizona, U.S., emerged as one of the world's worst coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) spots after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the middle of May. However, with the decisions to reimpose restrictions, the number of COVID-19 cases has been declining, and Arizona is considered to be a good model in slowing the epidemic. In this paper, we aimed to examine the COVID-19 situation in Arizona and assess the impact of human mobility change. We constructed the mobility integrated metapopulation susceptible-infectious-removed model and fitted to publicly available datasets on COVID-19 cases and mobility changes in Arizona. Our simulations showed that by reducing human mobility, the peak time was delayed, and the final size of the epidemic was decreased in all three regions. Our analysis suggests that rapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and, therefore, COVID-19 epidemics. Until a vaccine is available, reimplementations of mobility restrictions in response to the increase of new COVID-19 cases might need to be considered in Arizona and beyond.	1121
Vapur: A Search Engine to Find Related Protein-Compound Pairs in  COVID-19 Literature	Abdullatif Köksal,Hilal Dönmez,Rıza Özçelik,Elif Ozkirimli,Arzucan Özgür	2020/09/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02526v3	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) created dire consequences globally and triggered an intense scientific effort from different domains. The resulting publications created a huge text collection in which finding the studies related to a biomolecule of interest is challenging for general purpose search engines because the publications are rich in domain specific terminology. Here, we present Vapur: an online COVID-19 search engine specifically designed to find related protein - chemical pairs. Vapur is empowered with a relation-oriented inverted index that is able to retrieve and group studies for a query biomolecule with respect to its related entities. The inverted index of Vapur is automatically created with a BioNLP pipeline and integrated with an online user interface. The online interface is designed for the smooth traversal of the current literature by domain researchers and is publicly available at https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/vapur/ .	1122
IVACS: Intelligent Voice Assistant for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)  Self-Assessment	Parashar Dhakal,Praveen Damacharla,Ahmad Y. Javaid,Hari K. Vege,Vijay K. Devabhaktuni	2020/09/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02673v1	ArXiv	At the time of writing this paper, the world has around eleven million cases of COVID-19, scientifically known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-COV-2). One of the popular critical steps various health organizations are advocating to prevent the spread of this contagious disease is self-assessment of symptoms. Multiple organizations have already pioneered mobile and web-based applications for self-assessment of COVID-19 to reduce this global pandemic's spread. We propose an intelligent voice-based assistant for COVID-19 self-assessment (IVACS). This interactive assistant has been built to diagnose the symptoms related to COVID-19 using the guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The empirical testing of the application has been performed with 22 human subjects, all volunteers, using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX), and subjects performance accuracy has been measured. The results indicate that the IVACS is beneficial to users. However, it still needs additional research and development to promote its widespread application.	1123
Effect of lockdown interventions to control the COVID-19 epidemic in  India	Ankit Sharma,Shreyash Arya,Shashee Kumari,Arnab Chatterjee	2020/09/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03168v1	ArXiv	The pandemic caused by the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV2 has been responsible for life threatening health complications, and extreme pressure on healthcare systems. While preventive and definite curative medical interventions are yet to arrive, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) like physical isolation, quarantine and drastic social measures imposed by governing agencies are effective in arresting the spread of infections in a population. In densely populated countries like India, lockdown interventions are partially effective due to social and administrative complexities. Using detailed demographic data, we present an agent based model to imitate the behavior of the population and its mobility features, even under intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of contact tracing policies and how our model efficiently relates to empirical findings on testing efficiency. We also present various lockdown intervention strategies for mitigation - using the bare number of infections, the effective reproduction rate, as well as using reinforcement learning. Our analysis can help assess the socio-economic consequences of such interventions, and provide useful ideas and insights to policy makers for better decision making.	1124
Estimation for network snowball sampling: Preventing pandemics	Steve Thompson	2020/09/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04464v1	ArXiv	Snowball designs are the most natural of the network sampling designs. They have many desirable properties for sampling hidden and hard-to reach populations. They have been under-used in recent years because simple design-based estimators and confidence intervals have not been available for them. The needed estimation methods are supplied in this paper. Snowball sampling methods and accurate estimators with them are needed for sampling of the people exposed to the animals from which new coronavirus outbreaks originate, and to sample the animal populations to which they are exposed. Accurate estimates are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the risk to the people exposed to the animals. In this way the frequencies of major outbreaks and pandemics can be reduced. Snowball designs are needed in studies of sexual and opioid networks through which HIV can spread explosively, so that prevention intervention methods can be developed, accurately assessed, and effectively distributed.	1125
Multi-Objective Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Infectious  Disease Control	Runzhe Wan,Xinyu Zhang,Rui Song	2020/09/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04607v3	ArXiv	Severe infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pose a huge threat to public health. Stringent control measures, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, while having significant effects, also bring huge economic losses. In the face of an emerging infectious disease, a crucial question for policymakers is how to make the trade-off and implement the appropriate interventions timely given the huge uncertainty. In this work, we propose a Multi-Objective Model-based Reinforcement Learning framework to facilitate data-driven decision-making and minimize the overall long-term cost. Specifically, at each decision point, a Bayesian epidemiological model is first learned as the environment model, and then the proposed model-based multi-objective planning algorithm is applied to find a set of Pareto-optimal policies. This framework, combined with the prediction bands for each policy, provides a real-time decision support tool for policymakers. The application is demonstrated with the spread of COVID-19 in China.	1126
Adaptive Methods for Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting During  COVID-19 Lockdown in France	David Obst,Joseph de Vilmarest,Yannig Goude	2020/09/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06527v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has urged many governments in the world to enforce a strict lockdown where all nonessential businesses are closed and citizens are ordered to stay at home. One of the consequences of this policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since load forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are trained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused by the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the pandemic. This makes the scheduling of the electricity production challenging, and has a high cost for both electricity producers and grid operators. In this paper we introduce adaptive generalized additive models using Kalman filters and fine-tuning to adjust to new electricity consumption patterns. Additionally, knowledge from the lockdown in Italy is transferred to anticipate the change of behavior in France. The proposed methods are applied to forecast the electricity demand during the French lockdown period, where they demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce prediction errors compared to traditional models. Finally expert aggregation is used to leverage the specificities of each predictions and enhance results even further.	1127
What factors have caused Japanese prefectures to attract a larger  population influx?	Keisuke Kokubun	2020/09/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07144v1	ArXiv	Regional promotion and centralized correction in Tokyo have long been the goals of the Government of Japan. Furthermore, in the wake of the recent new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, the momentum for rural migration is increasing, to prevent the risk of infection with the help of penetration of remote work. However, there is not enough debate about what kind of land will attract the population. Therefore, in this paper, we will consider this problem by performing correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis with the inflow rate and the excess inflow rate of the population as the dependent variables, using recent government statistics for each prefecture. As a result of the analysis, in addition to economic factor variables, variables of climatic, amenity, and human factors correlated with the inflow rate, and it was shown that the model has the greatest explanatory power when multiple factors were used in addition to specific factors. Therefore, local prefectures are required to take regional promotion measures focusing on not only economic factors but also multifaceted factors to attract the outside population.	1128
Multi-Stage CNN Architecture for Face Mask Detection	Amit Chavda,Jason Dsouza,Sumeet Badgujar,Ankit Damani	2020/09/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07627v2	ArXiv	The end of 2019 witnessed the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has continued to be the cause of plight for millions of lives and businesses even in 2020. As the world recovers from the pandemic and plans to return to a state of normalcy, there is a wave of anxiety among all individuals, especially those who intend to resume in-person activity. Studies have proved that wearing a face mask significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission as well as provides a sense of protection. However, it is not feasible to manually track the implementation of this policy. Technology holds the key here. We introduce a Deep Learning based system that can detect instances where face masks are not used properly. Our system consists of a dual-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture capable of detecting masked and unmasked faces and can be integrated with pre-installed CCTV cameras. This will help track safety violations, promote the use of face masks, and ensure a safe working environment.	1129
Detection of Change Points in Piecewise Polynomial Signals Using Trend  Filtering	Reza V. Mehrizi,Shojaeddin Chenouri	2020/09/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08573v2	ArXiv	While many approaches have been proposed for discovering abrupt changes in piecewise constant signals, few methods are available to capture these changes in piecewise polynomial signals. In this paper, we propose a change point detection method, PRUTF, based on trend filtering. By providing a comprehensive dual solution path for trend filtering, PRUTF allows us to discover change points of the underlying signal for either a given value of the regularization parameter or a specific number of steps of the algorithm. We demonstrate that the dual solution path constitutes a Gaussian bridge process that enables us to derive an exact and efficient stopping rule for terminating the search algorithm. We also prove that the estimates produced by this algorithm are asymptotically consistent in pattern recovery. This result holds even in the case of staircases (consecutive change points of the same sign) in the signal. Finally, we investigate the performance of our proposed method for various signals and then compare its performance against some state-of-the-art methods in the context of change point detection. We apply our method to three real-world datasets including the UK House Price Index (HPI), the GISS surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) and the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.	1130
COVID-19 Literature Topic-Based Search via Hierarchical NMF	Rachel Grotheer,Yihuan Huang,Pengyu Li,Elizaveta Rebrova,Deanna Needell,Longxiu Huang,Alona Kryshchenko,Xia Li,Kyung Ha,Oleksandr Kryshchenko	2020/09/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09074v1	ArXiv	A dataset of COVID-19-related scientific literature is compiled, combining the articles from several online libraries and selecting those with open access and full text available. Then, hierarchical nonnegative matrix factorization is used to organize literature related to the novel coronavirus into a tree structure that allows researchers to search for relevant literature based on detected topics. We discover eight major latent topics and 52 granular subtopics in the body of literature, related to vaccines, genetic structure and modeling of the disease and patient studies, as well as related diseases and virology. In order that our tool may help current researchers, an interactive website is created that organizes available literature using this hierarchical structure.	1131
Google COVID-19 community mobility reports: insights from multi-criteria  decision making	Gabriela Cavalcante da Silvaa,Sabrina Oliveirab,Elizabeth F. Wanner,Leonardo C. T. Bezerra	2020/09/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10648v1	ArXiv	Social distancing (SD) has been critical in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To aid SD monitoring, many technology companies have made available mobility data, the most prominent example being the community mobility reports (CMR) provided by Google. Given the wide range of research fields that have been drawing insights from CMR data, there has been a rising concern for methodological discussion on how to use them. Indeed, Google recently released their own guidelines, concerning the nature of the place categories and the need for calibrating regional values. In this work, we discuss how measures developed in the field of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) might benefit researchers analyzing this data. Concretely, we discuss how Pareto dominance and performance measures adopted in MCDM enable the mobility evaluation for (i) multiple categories for a given time period and (ii) multiple categories over multiple time periods. We empirically demonstrate these approaches conducting both a region- and country-level analysis, comparing some of the most relevant outbreak examples from different continents.	1132
Viroinformatics-based investigation of SARS-CoV-2 core proteins for  potential therapeutic targets	Lokesh Agrawal,Thanasis Poullikkas,Scott Eisenhower,Carlo Monsanto,Ranjith Kumar Bakku	2020/09/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12817v1	ArXiv	Due to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) being a novel virus, there are currently no known effective antiviral drugs capable of slowing its progress. To accelerate the discovery of potential drug candidates, bioinformatics based in silico drug discovery can be applied as a very robust tool. In the present study, more than 60 antiviral drugs already available on the market, were chosen after literature survey. These can be used in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, these candidate drugs were ranked based on their potential to interact with the Spike protein and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the mechanism of their action as well as how the virus infection can utilize Hemoglobin to decrease the oxygen level in blood is explained. Moreover, multiple sequence alignments of the Spike protein with 75 sequences of different viruses from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily were performed. This gives insight into the evolutionarily conserved domains that can be targeted using drug or antibody treatment. This multidimensional study opens a new layer of understanding about the most effective drug-targetable sites on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.	1133
A hierarchical spatio-temporal model to analyze relative risk variations  of COVID-19: a focus on Spain, Italy and Germany	Abdollah Jalilian,Jorge Mateu	2020/09/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13577v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world in a short period of time and with a heterogeneous pattern. Understanding the underlying temporal and spatial dynamics in the spread of COVID-19 can result in informed and timely public health policies. In this paper, we use a spatio-temporal stochastic model to explain the temporal and spatial variations in the daily number of new confirmed cases in Spain, Italy and Germany from late February to mid September 2020. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that the temporal trend of the epidemic in the three countries rapidly reached their peaks and slowly started to decline at the beginning of April and then increased and reached their second maximum in August. However decline and increase of the temporal trend seems to be sharper in Spain and smoother in Germany. The spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk of COVID-19 in Spain is also more pronounced than Italy and Germany.	1134
Disruption in the Chinese E-Commerce During COVID-19	Yuan Yuan,Muzhi Guan,Zhilun Zhou,Sundong Kim,Meeyoung Cha,Depeng Jin,Yong Li	2020/07/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14605v2	ArXiv	The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions of citizens worldwide and claimed many lives. This paper examines its impact on the Chinese e-commerce market by analyzing behavioral changes seen from a large online shopping platform. We first conduct a time series analysis to identify product categories that faced the most extensive disruptions. The time-lagged analysis shows that behavioral patterns seen in shopping actions are highly responsive to epidemic development. Based on these findings, we present a consumer demand prediction method by encompassing the epidemic statistics and behavioral features for COVID-19 related products. Experiment results demonstrate that our predictions outperform existing baselines and further extend to the long-term and province-level forecasts. We discuss how our market analysis and prediction can help better prepare for future pandemics by gaining an extra time to launch preventive steps.	1135
Transformer based Automatic COVID-19 Fake News Detection System	Sunil Gundapu,Radhika Mamidi	2021/01/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00180v3	ArXiv	Recent rapid technological advancements in online social networks such as Twitter have led to a great incline in spreading false information and fake news. Misinformation is especially prevalent in the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, leading to individuals accepting bogus and potentially deleterious claims and articles. Quick detection of fake news can reduce the spread of panic and confusion among the public. For our analysis in this paper, we report a methodology to analyze the reliability of information shared on social media pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our best approach is based on an ensemble of three transformer models (BERT, ALBERT, and XLNET) to detecting fake news. This model was trained and evaluated in the context of the ConstraintAI 2021 shared task COVID19 Fake News Detection in English. Our system obtained 0.9855 f1-score on testset and ranked 5th among 160 teams.	1136
Monitoring the COVID-19 epidemic with nationwide telecommunication data	Joel Persson,Jurriaan F. Parie,Stefan Feuerriegel	2021/01/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02521v4	ArXiv	In response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), governments have introduced severe policy measures with substantial effects on human behavior. Here, we perform a large-scale, spatio-temporal analysis of human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. We derive human mobility from anonymized, aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland; February 10 - April 26, 2020), consisting of ~1.5 billion trips. In comparison to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by 49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than 5 people, which is estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such, human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7-13 days ahead. A 1% reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88-1.11% reduction in daily reported COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via telecommunication data can support public decision-makers in two ways. First, it helps in assessing policy impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for near real-time epidemic surveillance, thereby enabling evidence-based policies.	1137
Multistage BiCross encoder for multilingual access to COVID-19 health  information	Iknoor Singh,Carolina Scarton,Kalina Bontcheva	2021/01/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03013v3	ArXiv	The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rapidly growing 'infodemic' of health information online. This has motivated the need for accurate semantic search and retrieval of reliable COVID-19 information across millions of documents, in multiple languages. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel high precision and high recall neural Multistage BiCross encoder approach. It is a sequential three-stage ranking pipeline which uses the Okapi BM25 retrieval algorithm and transformer-based bi-encoder and cross-encoder to effectively rank the documents with respect to the given query. We present experimental results from our participation in the Multilingual Information Access (MLIA) shared task on COVID-19 multilingual semantic search. The independently evaluated MLIA results validate our approach and demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches according to nearly all evaluation metrics in cases of both monolingual and bilingual runs.	1138
Estimating functional parameters for understanding the impact of weather  and government interventions on COVID-19 outbreak	Chih-Li Sung	2021/01/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05350v2	ArXiv	As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shown profound effects on public health and the economy worldwide, it becomes crucial to assess the impact on the virus transmission and develop effective strategies to address the challenge. A new statistical model derived from the SIR epidemic model with functional parameters is proposed to understand the impact of weather and government interventions on the virus spread in the presence of asymptomatic infections among eight metropolitan areas in the United States. The model uses Bayesian inference with Gaussian process priors to study the functional parameters nonparametrically, and sensitivity analysis is adopted to investigate the main and interaction effects of these factors. This analysis reveals several important results including the potential interaction effects between weather and government interventions, which shed new light on the effective strategies for policymakers to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak.	1139
Impact of closing schools on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Evidence using panel data from Japan	Eiji Yamamura,Yoshiro Tsutsui	2021/01/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08476v1	ArXiv	The spread of the novel coronavirus disease caused schools in Japan to close to cope with the pandemic. In response to this, parents of students were obliged to care for their children during the daytime when they were usually at school. Does the increase in burden of childcare influence parents mental health? Based on short panel data from mid-March to mid-April 2020, we explored how school closures influenced the mental health of parents with school-aged children. Using the fixed effects model, we found that school closures lead to students mothers suffering from worse mental health than other females, while the fathers mental health did not differ from other males. This tendency was only observed for less educated mothers who had children attending primary school, but not those attending junior high school. The contribution of this paper is to show that school closures increased the inequality of mental health between genders and the educational background of parents.	1140
How does COVID-19 change insurance and vaccine demand? Evidence from  short-panel data in Japan	Eiji Yamamura,Yoshiro Tsutsui	2021/01/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08922v1	ArXiv	In this study, we explored how the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) affected the demand for insurance and vaccines in Japan from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Through independent internet surveys, respondents were asked hypothetical questions concerning the demand for insurance and vaccines for protection against COVID-19. Using the collected short-panel data, after controlling for individual characteristics using the fixed effects model, the key findings, within the context of the pandemic, were as follows: (1) Contrary to extant studies, the demand for insurance by females was smaller than that by their male counterparts; (2) The gap in demand for insurance between genders increased as the pandemic prevailed; (3) The demand for a vaccine by females was higher than that for males; and (4) As COVID-19 spread throughout Japan, demand for insurance decreased, whereas the demand for a vaccine increased.	1141
BU-Trace: A Permissionless Mobile System for Privacy-Preserving  Intelligent Contact Tracing	Zhe Peng,Jinbin Huang,Haixin Wang,Shihao Wang,Xiaowen Chu,Xinzhi Zhang,Li Chen,Xin Huang,Xiaoyi Fu,Yike Guo,Jianliang Xu	2021/01/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09653v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented health crisis for the global. Digital contact tracing, as a transmission intervention measure, has shown its effectiveness on pandemic control. Despite intensive research on digital contact tracing, existing solutions can hardly meet users' requirements on privacy and convenience. In this paper, we propose BU-Trace, a novel permissionless mobile system for privacy-preserving intelligent contact tracing based on QR code and NFC technologies. First, a user study is conducted to investigate and quantify the user acceptance of a mobile contact tracing system. Second, a decentralized system is proposed to enable contact tracing while protecting user privacy. Third, an intelligent behavior detection algorithm is designed to ease the use of our system. We implement BU-Trace and conduct extensive experiments in several real-world scenarios. The experimental results show that BU-Trace achieves a privacy-preserving and intelligent mobile system for contact tracing without requesting location or other privacy-related permissions.	1142
How COVID-19 influences healthcare workers' happiness: Panel data  analysis in Japan	Eiji Yamamura,Yoshiro Tsutsui	2021/01/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10408v1	ArXiv	Healthcare workers are more likely to be infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) because of unavoidable contact with infected people. Although they are equipped to reduce the likelihood of infection, their distress has increased. This study examines how COVID-19 influences healthcare workers' happiness, compared to other workers. We constructed panel data via Internet surveys during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan, from March to June 2020, by surveying the same respondents at different times. The survey period started before the state of emergency, and ended after deregulation. The key findings are as follows. (1) Overall, the happiness level of healthcare workers is lower than that of other workers. (2) The biggest disparity in happiness level, between healthcare workers and others, was observed after deregulation and not during the state of emergency. After deregulation, the difference was larger by 0.26 points, on an 11-point scale, than in the initial wave before the state of emergency.	1143
CML-COVID: A Large-Scale COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Latent Topics,  Sentiment and Location Information	Hassan Dashtian,Dhiraj Murthy	2021/01/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12202v1	ArXiv	As a platform, Twitter has been a significant public space for discussion related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public social media platforms such as Twitter represent important sites of engagement regarding the pandemic and these data can be used by research teams for social, health, and other research. Understanding public opinion about COVID-19 and how information diffuses in social media is important for governments and research institutions. Twitter is a ubiquitous public platform and, as such, has tremendous utility for understanding public perceptions, behavior, and attitudes related to COVID-19. In this research, we present CML-COVID, a COVID-19 Twitter data set of 19,298,967 million tweets from 5,977,653 unique individuals and summarize some of the attributes of these data. These tweets were collected between March 2020 and July 2020 using the query terms coronavirus, covid and mask related to COVID-19. We use topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and descriptive statistics to describe the tweets related to COVID-19 we collected and the geographical location of tweets, where available. We provide information on how to access our tweet dataset (archived using twarc).	1144
Reliable COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-ray Images	Aysen Degerli,Mete Ahishali,Serkan Kiranyaz,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Moncef Gabbouj	2021/01/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12254v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep networks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus, there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616 images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.	1145
Examining socioeconomic factors to understand the hospital case-fatality  rates of COVID-19 in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil	Camila Lorenz,Patricia Marques Moralejo Bermudi,Marcelo Antunes Failla,Breno Souza de Aguiar,Tatiana Natasha Toporcov,Francisco Chiaravalloti Neto,Ligia Vizeu Barrozo	2021/02/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00594v1	ArXiv	Understanding differences in hospital case-fatality rates (HCFRs) of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may help evaluate its severity and the capacity of the healthcare system to reduce mortality. We examined the variability in HCFRs of COVID-19 in relation to spatial inequalities in socioeconomic factors across the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We found that HCFRs were higher for men and for individuals aged 60 years and older. Our models identified per capita income as a significant factor that is negatively associated with the HCFRs of COVID-19, even after adjusting by age, sex and presence of risk factors.	1146
Deep Learning for Virus-Spreading Forecasting: a Brief Survey	Federico Baldo,Lorenzo Dall'Olio,Mattia Ceccarelli,Riccardo Scheda,Michele Lombardi,Andrea Borghesi,Stefano Diciotti,Michela Milano	2021/03/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02346v1	ArXiv	The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has sparked the interest in predictive models capable of forecasting virus-spreading, especially for boosting and supporting decision-making processes. In this paper, we will outline the main Deep Learning approaches aimed at predicting the spreading of a disease in space and time. The aim is to show the emerging trends in this area of research and provide a general perspective on the possible strategies to approach this problem. In doing so, we will mainly focus on two macro-categories: classical Deep Learning approaches and Hybrid models. Finally, we will discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of different models, and underline the most promising development directions to improve these approaches.	1147
Modeling Macroeconomic Variations After COVID-19	Serena Ng	2021/03/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02732v4	ArXiv	The coronavirus is a global event of historical proportions and just a few months changed the time series properties of the data in ways that make many pre-covid forecasting models inadequate. It also creates a new problem for estimation of economic factors and dynamic causal effects because the variations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the distribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the latter view and use covid indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data prior to estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020 even though real economic activity has recovered and covid uncertainty has receded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude and shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or indirectly modeling covid and treating it as exogenous. These responses to economic shocks are distinctly different from those to a covid shock which are much larger but shorter lived. Disentangling the two types of shocks can be important in macroeconomic modeling post-covid.	1148
When Face Recognition Meets Occlusion: A New Benchmark	Baojin Huang,Zhongyuan Wang,Guangcheng Wang,Kui Jiang,Kangli Zeng,Zhen Han,Xin Tian,Yuhong Yang	2021/03/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02805v1	ArXiv	The existing face recognition datasets usually lack occlusion samples, which hinders the development of face recognition. Especially during the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic, wearing a mask has become an effective means of preventing the virus spread. Traditional CNN-based face recognition models trained on existing datasets are almost ineffective for heavy occlusion. To this end, we pioneer a simulated occlusion face recognition dataset. In particular, we first collect a variety of glasses and masks as occlusion, and randomly combine the occlusion attributes (occlusion objects, textures,and colors) to achieve a large number of more realistic occlusion types. We then cover them in the proper position of the face image with the normal occlusion habit. Furthermore, we reasonably combine original normal face images and occluded face images to form our final dataset, termed as Webface-OCC. It covers 804,704 face images of 10,575 subjects, with diverse occlusion types to ensure its diversity and stability. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the ArcFace retrained by our dataset significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts. Webface-OCC is available at https://github.com/Baojin-Huang/Webface-OCC.	1149
The impact of state capacity on the cross-country variations in COVID-19  vaccination rates	Dragan Tevdovski,Petar Jolakoski,Viktor Stojkoski	2021/03/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04981v1	ArXiv	The initial period of vaccination shows strong heterogeneity between countries' vaccinations rollout, both in the terms of the start of the vaccination process and in the dynamics of the number of people that are vaccinated. A predominant thesis in the ongoing debate on the drivers of this observed heterogeneity is that a key determinant of the swift and extensive vaccine rollout is state capacity. Here, we utilize two measures that quantify different aspects of the state capacity: i) the external capacity (measured through the soft power and the economic power of the country) and ii) the internal capacity (measured via the country's government effectiveness) and investigate their relationship with the coronavirus vaccination outcome in the initial period (up to 30th January 2021). By using data on 189 countries and a two-step Heckman approach, we find that the economic power of the country and its soft power are robust determinants of whether a country has started with the vaccination process. In addition, the government effectiveness is a key factor that determines vaccine roll-out. Altogether, our findings are in line with the hypothesis that state capacity determines the observed heterogeneity between countries in the initial period of COVID-19 vaccines rollout.	1150
Quadruple Augmented Pyramid Network for Multi-class COVID-19  Segmentation via CT	Ziyang Wang,Irina Voiculescu	2021/03/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05546v2	ArXiv	COVID-19, a new strain of coronavirus disease, has been one of the most serious and infectious disease in the world. Chest CT is essential in prognostication, diagnosing this disease, and assessing the complication. In this paper, a multi-class COVID-19 CT segmentation is proposed aiming at helping radiologists estimate the extent of effected lung volume. We utilized four augmented pyramid networks on an encoder-decoder segmentation framework. Quadruple Augmented Pyramid Network (QAP-Net) not only enable CNN capture features from variation size of CT images, but also act as spatial interconnections and down-sampling to transfer sufficient feature information for semantic segmentation. Experimental results achieve competitive performance in segmentation with the Dice of 0.8163, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the proposed framework can segments of consolidation as well as glass, ground area via COVID-19 chest CT efficiently and accurately.	1151
Fused Deep Features Based Classification Framework for COVID-19  Classification with Optimized MLP	Saban Ozturk,Enes Yigit,Umut Ozkaya	2021/03/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09904v1	ArXiv	The new type of Coronavirus disease called COVID-19 continues to spread quite rapidly. Although it shows some specific symptoms, this disease, which can show different symptoms in almost every individual, has caused hundreds of thousands of patients to die. Although healthcare professionals work hard to prevent further loss of life, the rate of disease spread is very high. For this reason, the help of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is vital. In this study, a method based on optimization of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is the most effective image analysis method of today, is proposed to fulfill the mentioned COVID-19 detection needs. First, COVID-19 images are trained using ResNet-50 and VGG-16 architectures. Then, features in the last layer of these two architectures are combined with feature fusion. These new image features matrices obtained with feature fusion are classified for COVID detection. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure optimized by the whale optimization algorithm is used for the classification process. The obtained results show that the performance of the proposed framework is almost 4.5% higher than VGG-16 performance and almost 3.5% higher than ResNet-50 performance.	1152
The evolving ecosystem of COVID-19 contact tracing applications	Benjamin Levy,Matthew Stewart	2021/03/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10585v1	ArXiv	Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, there has been increased interest in the use of digital contact tracing as a means of stopping chains of viral transmission, provoking alarm from privacy advocates. Concerning the ethics of this technology, recent studies have predominantly focused on (1) the formation of guidelines for ethical contact tracing, (2) the analysis of specific implementations, or (3) the review of a select number of contact tracing applications and their relevant privacy or ethical implications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive survey of the evolving ecosystem of COVID-19 tracing applications, examining 152 contact tracing applications and assessing the extent to which they comply with existing guidelines for ethical contact tracing. The assessed criteria cover areas including data collection and storage, transparency and consent, and whether the implementation is open source. We find that although many apps released early in the pandemic fell short of best practices, apps released more recently, following the publication of the Apple/Google exposure notification protocol, have tended to be more closely aligned with ethical contact tracing principles. This dataset will be publicly available and may be updated as the pandemic continues.	1153
Spatio-Temporal Neural Network for Fitting and Forecasting COVID-19	Yi-Shuai Niu,Wentao Ding,Junpeng Hu,Wenxu Xu,Stephane Canu	2021/03/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11860v1	ArXiv	We established a Spatio-Temporal Neural Network, namely STNN, to forecast the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak worldwide in 2020. The basic structure of STNN is similar to the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) incorporating with not only temporal data but also spatial features. Two improved STNN architectures, namely the STNN with Augmented Spatial States (STNN-A) and the STNN with Input Gate (STNN-I), are proposed, which ensure more predictability and flexibility. STNN and its variants can be trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm and its improved variants (e.g., Adam, AdaGrad and RMSProp). Our STNN models are compared with several classical epidemic prediction models, including the fully-connected neural network (BPNN), and the recurrent neural network (RNN), the classical curve fitting models, as well as the SEIR dynamical system model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that STNN models outperform many others by providing more accurate fitting and prediction, and by handling both spatial and temporal data.	1154
Quantitative Assessment of U.S. Bulk Power Systems and Market Operations  during COVID-19	Guangchun Ruan,Jiahan Wu,Haiwang Zhong,Qing Xia,Le Xie	2020/08/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12515v1	ArXiv	Starting in early 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severely affected the U.S., causing substantial changes in the operations of bulk power systems and electricity markets. In this paper, we develop a data-driven analysis to substantiate the pandemic's impacts from the perspectives of power system security, electric power generation, electric power demand and electricity prices. Our results suggest that both electric power demand and electricity prices have discernibly dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic. Geographical variances in the impact are observed and quantified, and the bulk power market and power system operations in the northeast region are most severely affected. All the data sources, assessment criteria, and analysis codes reported in this paper are available on a GitHub repository.	1155
Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italy's country reputation and stock  market performance: a sentiment analysis approach	Gianpaolo Zammarchi,Francesco Mola,Claudio Conversano	2021/03/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13871v1	ArXiv	During the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the microblogging service Twitter has been widely used to share opinions and reactions to events. Italy was one of the first European countries to be severely affected by the outbreak and to establish lockdown and stay-at-home orders, potentially leading to country reputation damage. We resort to sentiment analysis to investigate changes in opinions about Italy reported on Twitter before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using different lexicons-based methods, we find a breakpoint corresponding to the date of the first established case of COVID-19 in Italy that causes a relevant change in sentiment scores used as proxy of the country reputation. Next, we demonstrate that sentiment scores about Italy are strongly associated with the levels of the FTSE-MIB index, the Italian Stock Exchange main index, as they serve as early detection signals of changes in the values of FTSE-MIB. Finally, we make a content-based classification of tweets into positive and negative and use two machine learning classifiers to validate the assigned polarity of tweets posted before and after the outbreak.	1156
Should international borders re-open? The impact of travel restrictions  on COVID-19 importation risk	Jessica Liebig,Kamran Najeebullah,Raja Jurdak,Ahmad El Shoghri,Dean Paini	2020/10/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14462v1	ArXiv	Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread across the world at an unprecedented pace, reaching over 200 countries and territories in less than three months. In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open. Authorities may consider the presented information when planning a phased re-opening of international borders.	1157
Use of alternative data: High frequency readout of the situation --  COVID policies, mobility, and R-Number	Ashutosh Mani Dixit,Suraj Regmi	2021/08/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00050v1	ArXiv	Alternative data have a big role, especially during a crisis. The months of stalemate have made us realize their importance for policy responses. In Nepal, the Government has exerted stay put measures, and physical data collection activities are suspended. The confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been increasing steadily and the country is on high alert. In this impasse, the number of secondary cases one would produce over the course of outbreak -- the reproduction number is useful to monitor the transmissibility of COVID-19. As the R-value is rapidly changing, it can be affected by a range of factors, including not just how infectious a disease is but how Government responds to it, and how the population behaves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested to the Government of Nepal several recommendations to contain the further spread of COVID-19. To get a sense of how Nepal is coping with the coronavirus pandemic we look at the alternative data sets to get a better understanding of the pandemic policies, mobility, and R-value during COVID.	1158
Coagulapathies after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may be derived from  a combination effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and adenovirus  vector-triggered signaling pathways	Ralf Kircheis	2021/08/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00089v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with worldwide 6-digital infection rates and thousands death tolls daily. Enormeous effords are undertaken to achieve high coverage of immunization in order to reach herd immunity to stop spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, based either on mRNA, viral vectors, or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus have been approved and are being applied worldwide. However, recently increased numbers of normally very rare types of thromboses associated with thrombocytopenia have been reported in particular in the context of the adenoviral vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 from Astra Zeneca. While statistical prevalence of these side effects seem to correlate with this particular vaccine type, i.e. adenonoviral vector based vaccines, the exact molecular mechanisms are still not clear. The present review summarizes current data and hypotheses for molecular and cellular mechanisms into one integrated hypothesis indicating that coagulopathies, including thromboses, thrombocytopenia and other related side effects are correlated to an interplay of the two components in the vaccine, i.e. the spike antigen and the adenoviral vector, with the innate and immune system which under certain circumstances can imitate the picture of a limited COVID-19 pathological picture.	1159
Automated detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images using deep  neural network and XGBoost	Hamid Nasiri,Sharif Hasani	2021/09/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02428v1	ArXiv	In late 2019 and after COVID-19 pandemic in the world, many researchers and scholars have tried to provide methods for detection of COVID-19 cases. Accordingly, this study focused on identifying COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. In this paper, a novel approach to diagnosing coronavirus disease from X-ray images was proposed. In the proposed method, DenseNet169 deep neural network was used to extract the features of X-ray images taken from the patients' chest and the extracted features were then given as input to the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm so that it could perform the classification task. Evaluation of the proposed approach and its comparison with the methods presented in recent years revealed that the proposed method was more accurate and faster than the existing ones and had an acceptable performance in detection of COVID-19 cases from X-ray images.	1160
SpatialViewer: A Remote Work Sharing Tool that Considers Intimacy Among  Workers	Sicheng Li,Yudai Makioka,Kyousuke Kobayashi,Haoran Xie,Kentaro Takashima	2021/09/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03016v1	ArXiv	"Due to the influence of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), teleworking has been expanding rapidly. Although existing interactive remote working systems are convenient, they do not allow users to adjust their spatial distance to team members at will, %""Arbitrarily"" is probably not the best word here. It means without apparent reason. A better expression might be ""at will."" and they ignore the discomfort caused by different levels of intimacy. To solve this issue, we propose a telework support system using spatial augmented reality technology. This system calibrates the space in which videos are projected with real space and adjusts the spatial distance between users by changing the position of projections. Users can switch the projection position of the video using hand-wave gestures. We also synchronize audio according to distance to further emphasize the sense of space within the remote interaction: the distance between projection position and user is inversely proportional to the audio volume. We conducted a telework experiment and a questionnaire survey to evaluate our system. The results show that the system enables users to adjust distance according to intimacy and thus improve the users' comfort."	1161
Modeling Systems with Machine Learning based Differential Equations	Pedro Garcia	2021/09/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05935v1	ArXiv	The prediction of behavior in dynamical systems, is frequently subject to the design of models. When a time series obtained from observing the system is available, the task can be performed by designing the model from these observations without additional assumptions or by assuming a preconceived structure in the model, with the help of additional information about the system. In the second case, it is a question of adequately combining theory with observations and subsequently optimizing the mixture. In this work, we proposes the design of time-continuous models of dynamical systems as solutions of differential equations, from non-uniform sampled or noisy observations, using machine learning techniques. The performance of strategy is shown with both, several simulated data sets and experimental data from Hare-Lynx population and Coronavirus 2019 outbreack. Our results suggest that this approach to the modeling systems, can be an useful technique in the case of synthetic or experimental data.	1162
Two-population SIR model and strategies to reduce mortality in pandemics	Long Ma,Maksim Kitsak,Piet Van Mieghem	2021/09/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05964v1	ArXiv	Despite many studies on the transmission mechanism of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it remains still challenging to efficiently reduce mortality. In this work, we apply a two-population Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to investigate the COVID-19 spreading when contacts between elderly and non-elderly individuals are reduced due to the high mortality risk of elderly people. We discover that the reduction of connections between two populations can delay the death curve but cannot well reduce the final mortality. We propose a merged SIR model, which advises elderly individuals to interact less with their non-elderly connections at the initial stage but interact more with their non-elderly relationships later, to reduce the final mortality. Finally, immunizing elderly hub individuals can also significantly decrease mortality.	1163
Learning trends of COVID-19 using semi-supervised clustering	Semhar Michael,Xuwen Zhu,Volodymyr Melnykov	2021/09/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06955v1	ArXiv	A finite mixture model is used to learn trends from the currently available data on coronavirus (COVID-19). Data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 related cases and deaths for European countries and the United States (US) are explored. A semi-supervised clustering approach with positive equivalence constraints is used to incorporate country and state information into the model. The analysis of trends in the rates of cases and deaths is carried out jointly using a mixture of multivariate Gaussian non-linear regression models with a mean trend specified using a generalized logistic function. The optimal number of clusters is chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. The resulting clusters provide insight into different mitigation strategies adopted by US states and European countries. The obtained results help identify the current relative standing of individual states and show a possible future if they continue with the chosen mitigation technique	1164
Critical weaknesses in shielding strategies for COVID-19	Cameron A. Smith,Christian A. Yates,Ben Ashby	2021/09/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07300v2	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has led to a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented around the world to curb transmission. However, the economic and social costs of some of these measures, especially lockdowns, has been high. An alternative and widely discussed public health strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic would have been to 'shield' those most vulnerable to COVID-19 (minimising their contacts with others), while allowing infection to spread among lower risk individuals with the aim of reaching herd immunity. Here we retrospectively explore the effectiveness of this strategy using a stochastic SEIR framework, showing that even under the unrealistic assumption of perfect shielding, hospitals would have been rapidly overwhelmed with many avoidable deaths among lower risk individuals. Crucially, even a small (20%) reduction in the effectiveness of shielding would have likely led to a large increase (>150%) in the number of deaths compared to perfect shielding. Our findings demonstrate that shielding the vulnerable while allowing infections to spread among the wider population would not have been a viable public health strategy for COVID-19 and is unlikely to be effective for future pandemics.	1165
Interoperability of statistical models in pandemic preparedness:  principles and reality	George Nicholson,Marta Blangiardo,Mark Briers,Peter J. Diggle,Tor Erlend Fjelde,Hong Ge,Robert J. B. Goudie,Radka Jersakova,Ruairidh E. King,Brieuc C. L.

Interoperability provides an important set of principles for future pandemic preparedness, through the joint design and deployment of adaptable systems of statistical models for disease surveillance using probabilistic reasoning. We illustrate this through case studies for inferring spatial-temporal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevalence and reproduction numbers in England."	1166
Omicron (B.1.1.529): Infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody  resistance	Jiahui Chen,Rui Wang,Nancy Benovich Gilby,Guo-Wei Wei	2021/12/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01318v1	ArXiv	The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine-breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data points and extensively validated by experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over ten times more contagious than the original virus or about twice as infectious as the Delta variant. Based on 132 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may be twice more likely to escape current vaccines than the Delta variant. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from Celltrion and Rockefeller University. However, its impact on Regeneron mAb cocktail appears to be mild.	1167
A Statistics and Deep Learning Hybrid Method for Multivariate Time  Series Forecasting and Mortality Modeling	Thabang Mathonsi,Terence L. van Zyl	2021/12/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08618v1	ArXiv	Hybrid methods have been shown to outperform pure statistical and pure deep learning methods at forecasting tasks and quantifying the associated uncertainty with those forecasts (prediction intervals). One example is Exponential Smoothing Recurrent Neural Network (ES-RNN), a hybrid between a statistical forecasting model and a recurrent neural network variant. ES-RNN achieves a 9.4\% improvement in absolute error in the Makridakis-4 Forecasting Competition. This improvement and similar outperformance from other hybrid models have primarily been demonstrated only on univariate datasets. Difficulties with applying hybrid forecast methods to multivariate data include ($i$) the high computational cost involved in hyperparameter tuning for models that are not parsimonious, ($ii$) challenges associated with auto-correlation inherent in the data, as well as ($iii$) complex dependency (cross-correlation) between the covariates that may be hard to capture. This paper presents Multivariate Exponential Smoothing Long Short Term Memory (MES-LSTM), a generalized multivariate extension to ES-RNN, that overcomes these challenges. MES-LSTM utilizes a vectorized implementation. We test MES-LSTM on several aggregated coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity datasets and find our hybrid approach shows consistent, significant improvement over pure statistical and deep learning methods at forecast accuracy and prediction interval construction.	1168
Examining Older Adults' Information Exposure, Wellbeing, and Adherence  to Protective Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Nurul Suhaimi,Nutchanon Yongsatianchot,Yixuan Zhang,Anisa Amiji,Shivani A. Patel,Stacy Marsella,Miso Kim,Jacqueline Griffin,Andrea Parker	2021/12/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11215v1	ArXiv	Older adults are at greater risk of experiencing negative physical and psychological impacts of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our ongoing study is assessing COVID-19 information exposure in adults aged 55 and above compared to other age groups living in Massachusetts and Georgia. This work investigates the potential association between information exposure and wellbeing as well as adherence to COVID-19 protective measures. Our initial results show that older adults received information related to COVID-19 less frequently than the middle-aged group, yet they feel more content and less stressed than the other age groups. Further analysis to identify other potential confounding variables is addressed.	1169
Bayesian Changepoint Estimation for Spatially Indexed Functional Time  Series	Mengchen Wang,Trevor Harris,Bo Li	2022/01/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02742v1	ArXiv	We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to simultaneously estimate mean based changepoints in spatially correlated functional time series. Unlike previous methods that assume a shared changepoint at all spatial locations or ignore spatial correlation, our method treats changepoints as a spatial process. This allows our model to respect spatial heterogeneity and exploit spatial correlations to improve estimation. Our method is derived from the ubiquitous cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic that dominates changepoint detection in functional time series. However, instead of directly searching for the maximum of the CUSUM based processes, we build spatially correlated two-piece linear models with appropriate variance structure to locate all changepoints at once. The proposed linear model approach increases the robustness of our method to variability in the CUSUM process, which, combined with our spatial correlation model, improves changepoint estimation near the edges. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies that our method outperforms existing functional changepoint estimators in terms of both estimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification, under either weak and strong spatial correlation, and weak and strong change signals. Finally, we demonstrate our method using a temperature data set and a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) study.	1170
Exploring auditory acoustic features for the diagnosis of the Covid-19	Madhu R. Kamble,Jose Patino,Maria A. Zuluaga,Massimiliano Todisco	2022/01/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09110v1	ArXiv	The current outbreak of a coronavirus, has quickly escalated to become a serious global problem that has now been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. Infectious diseases know no borders, so when it comes to controlling outbreaks, timing is absolutely essential. It is so important to detect threats as early as possible, before they spread. After a first successful DiCOVA challenge, the organisers released second DiCOVA challenge with the aim of diagnosing COVID-19 through the use of breath, cough and speech audio samples. This work presents the details of the automatic system for COVID-19 detection using breath, cough and speech recordings. We developed different front-end auditory acoustic features along with a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM) as classifier. The results are promising and have demonstrated the high complementary behaviour among the auditory acoustic features in the Breathing, Cough and Speech tracks giving an AUC of 86.60% on the test set.	1171
Hyperparameter Optimization for COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Classification	Ibraheem Hamdi,Muhammad Ridzuan,Mohammad Yaqub	2022/01/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10885v1	ArXiv	Despite the introduction of vaccines, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains a worldwide dilemma, continuously developing new variants such as Delta and the recent Omicron. The current standard for testing is through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, PCRs can be expensive, slow, and/or inaccessible to many people. X-rays on the other hand have been readily used since the early 20th century and are relatively cheaper, quicker to obtain, and typically covered by health insurance. With a careful selection of model, hyperparameters, and augmentations, we show that it is possible to develop models with 83% accuracy in binary classification and 64% in multi-class for detecting COVID-19 infections from chest x-rays.	1172
Reducing COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Applying Blockchain in Vaccination  Rollout Management	Jorge Medina,Roberto Rojas-Cessa,Vatcharapan Umpaichitra	2022/01/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11748v2	ArXiv	Because a fast vaccination rollout against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical to restore daily life and avoid virus mutations, it is tempting to have a relaxed vaccination-administration management system. However, a robust management system can support the enforcement of preventive measures, and in turn, reduce incidence and deaths. Here, we model a trustable and reliable management system based on blockchain for vaccine distribution by extending the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model. The model includes prevention measures such as mask-wearing, social distance, vaccination rate, and vaccination efficiency. It also considers negative social behavior, such as violations of social distance and attempts of using illegitimate vaccination proofs. By evaluating the model, we show that the proposed system can reduce up to 2.5 million cases and half a million deaths in the most demanding scenarios.	1173
Optimal classification and generalized prevalence estimates for  diagnostic settings with more than two classes	Rayanne A. Luke,Anthony J. Kearsley,Paul N. Patrone	2022/10/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02366v1	ArXiv	"An accurate multiclass classification strategy is crucial to interpreting antibody tests. However, traditional methods based on confidence intervals or receiver operating characteristics lack clear extensions to settings with more than two classes. We address this problem by developing a multiclass classification based on probabilistic modeling and optimal decision theory that minimizes the convex combination of false classification rates. The classification process is challenging when the relative fraction of the population in each class, or generalized prevalence, is unknown. Thus, we also develop a method for estimating the generalized prevalence of test data that is independent of classification. We validate our approach on serological data with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) na\""ive, previously infected, and vaccinated classes. Synthetic data are used to demonstrate that (i) prevalence estimates are unbiased and converge to true values and (ii) our procedure applies to arbitrary measurement dimensions. In contrast to the binary problem, the multiclass setting offers wide-reaching utility as the most general framework and provides new insight into prevalence estimation best practices."	1174
Ensemble Learning using Transformers and Convolutional Networks for  Masked Face Recognition	Mohammed R. Al-Sinan,Aseel F. Haneef,Hamzah Luqman	2022/10/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04816v1	ArXiv	Wearing a face mask is one of the adjustments we had to follow to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Having our faces covered by masks constantly has driven the need to understand and investigate how this behavior affects the recognition capability of face recognition systems. Current face recognition systems have extremely high accuracy when dealing with unconstrained general face recognition cases but do not generalize well with occluded masked faces. In this work, we propose a system for masked face recognition. The proposed system comprises two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and two Transformer models. The CNN models have been fine-tuned on FaceNet pre-trained model. We ensemble the predictions of the four models using the majority voting technique to identify the person with the mask. The proposed system has been evaluated on a synthetically masked LFW dataset created in this work. The best accuracy is obtained using the ensembled models with an accuracy of 92%. This recognition rate outperformed the accuracy of other models and it shows the correctness and robustness of the proposed model for recognizing masked faces.

Emerging dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants	Jiahui Chen,Rui Wang,Yuta Hozumi,Gengzhuo Liu,Yuchi Qiu,Xiaoqi Wei,Guo-Wei Wei	2022/10/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09485v1	ArXiv	Accurate and reliable forecasting of emerging dominant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants enables policymakers and vaccine makers to get prepared for future waves of infections. The last three waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by dominant variants Omicron (BA.1), BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5 were accurately foretold by our artificial intelligence (AI) models built with biophysics, genotyping of viral genomes, experimental data, algebraic topology, and deep learning. Based on newly available experimental data, we analyzed the impacts of all possible viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our analysis sheds light on viral evolutionary mechanisms, i.e., natural selection through infectivity strengthening and antibody resistance. We forecast that BA.2.10.4, BA.2.75, BQ.1.1, and particularly, BA.2.75+R346T, have high potential to become new dominant variants to drive the next surge.	1176
A Time Delay Dynamic System with External Source for the Local Outbreak  of 2019-nCoV	Yu Chen,Jin Cheng,Yu Jiang,Keji Liu	2020/02/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02590v1	ArXiv	How to model the 2019 CoronaVirus (2019-nCov) spread in China is one of the most urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics. In this paper, we propose a novel time delay dynamic system with external source to describe the trend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in the newly proposed dynamic system, which can be considered as the suspected people travel to different areas. The numerical simulations exhibit the dynamic system with the external source is more reliable than the one without it, and the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation results with the public data, we suggest that the local government should have some more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of control.	1177
Protein structure and sequence re-analysis of 2019-nCoV genome does not  indicate snakes as its intermediate host or the unique similarity between its  spike protein insertions and HIV-1	Chengxin Zhang,Wei Zheng,Xiaoqiang Huang,Eric W. Bell,Xiaogen Zhou,Yang Zhang	2020/02/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03173v1	ArXiv	"As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed. In this report, we re-analyzed the computational approaches and findings presented in two recent manuscripts by Ji et al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682) and by Pradhan et al. (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871), which concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions shared a unique similarity to HIV-1. Results from our re-implementation of the analyses, built on larger-scale datasets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, do not support the conclusions proposed by these manuscripts. Based on our analyses and existing data of coronaviruses, we concluded that the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV are more likely to be mammals and birds than snakes, and that the ""novel insertions"" observed in the spike protein are naturally evolved from bat coronaviruses."	1178
A Robust Stochastic Method of Estimating the Transmission Potential of  2019-nCoV	Jun Li	2020/02/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03828v1	ArXiv	The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has quickly evolved into a global health crisis. The transmission potential of 2019-nCoV has been modelled and studied in several recent research works. The key factors such as the basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$, of the virus have been identified by fitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data include the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities over the world. In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV from the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light of varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak. Sample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when outliers are present. The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters of transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with $R_0:8\sim14$, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large initial infected group.	1179
Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China by dynamical modeling	Liangrong Peng,Wuyue Yang,Dongyan Zhang,Changjing Zhuge,Liu Hong	2020/02/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06563v2	ArXiv	The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan has attracted worldwide attention. Here, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze this epidemic. Based on the public data of National Health Commission of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, 2020, we reliably estimate key epidemic parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for 5 different regions. According to optimistic estimation, the epidemics in Beijing and Shanghai will end soon within two weeks, while for most part of China, including the majority of cities in Hubei province, the success of anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th. We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. Moreover, by inverse inference, we find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei province and Wuhan all can be dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling time is around two days at the early stage.	1180
The Outbreak Evaluation of COVID-19 in Wuhan District of China	Yimin Zhou,Zuguo Chen,Xiangdong Wu,Zengwu Tian,Liang Cheng,Lingjian Ye	2020/02/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09640v1	ArXiv	There were 27 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, named as 2019-nCoV temporarily and COVID-19 formally by WHO on 11 February, 2020. In December 2019 and January 2020, COVID-19 has spread in large scale among the population, which brought terrible disaster to the life and property of the Chinese people. In this paper, we will first analyze the feature and pattern of the virus transmission, and discuss the key impact factors and uncontrollable factors of epidemic transmission based on public data. Then the virus transmission can be modelled and used for the inflexion and extinction period of epidemic development so as to provide theoretical support for the Chinese government in the decision-making of epidemic prevention and recovery of economic production. Further, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the prevention methods taken by the Chinese government such as multi-level administrative region isolation. It is of great importance and practical significance for the world to deal with public health emergencies.	1181
Molecular docking studies on Jensenone from eucalyptus essential oil as  a potential inhibitor of COVID 19 corona virus infection	Arun Dev Sharma,Inderjeet Kaur	2020/04/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00217v2	ArXiv	COVID-19, a member of corona virus family is spreading its tentacles across the world due to lack of drugs at present. However, the main viral proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro) has recently been regarded as a suitable target for drug design against SARS infection due to its vital role in polyproteins processing necessary for coronavirus reproduction. The present in silico study was designed to evaluate the effect of Jensenone, a essential oil component from eucalyptus oil, on Mpro by docking study. In the present study, molecular docking studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools. Protein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions Calculator.The calculated parameters such as binding energy, and binding site similarity indicated effective binding of Jensenone to COVID-19 proteinase. Active site prediction further validated the role of active site residues in ligand binding. PIC results indicated that, Mpro/ Jensenone complexes forms hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond interactions and strong ionic interactions. Therefore, Jensenone may represent potential treatment potential to act as COVID-19 Mpro inhibitor. However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential medicinal use.	1182
An ARIMA model to forecast the spread and the final size of COVID-2019  epidemic in Italy	Gaetano Perone	2020/04/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00382v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) is a severe ongoing novel pandemic that is spreading quickly across the world. Italy, that is widely considered one of the main epicenters of the pandemic, has registered the highest COVID-2019 death rates and death toll in the world, to the present day. In this article I estimate an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the epidemic trend over the period after April 4, 2020, by using the Italian epidemiological data at national and regional level. The data refer to the number of daily confirmed cases officially registered by the Italian Ministry of Health (www.salute.gov.it) for the period February 20 to April 4, 2020. The main advantage of this model is that it is easy to manage and fit. Moreover, it may give a first understanding of the basic trends, by suggesting the hypothetic epidemic's inflection point and final size.	1183
Neural network based country wise risk prediction of COVID-19	Ratnabali Pal,Arif Ahmed Sekh,Samarjit Kar,Dilip K. Prasad	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00959v2	ArXiv	The recent worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has opened up new challenges to the research community. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods can be useful to predict the parameters, risks, and effects of such an epidemic. Such predictions can be helpful to control and prevent the spread of such diseases. The main challenges of applying AI is the small volume of data and the uncertain nature. Here, we propose a shallow long short-term memory (LSTM) based neural network to predict the risk category of a country. We have used a Bayesian optimization framework to optimize and automatically design country-specific networks. The results show that the proposed pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods for data of 180 countries and can be a useful tool for such risk categorization. We have also experimented with the trend data and weather data combined for the prediction. The outcome shows that the weather does not have a significant role. The tool can be used to predict long-duration outbreak of such an epidemic such that we can take preventive steps earlier	1184
Identifying Radiological Findings Related to COVID-19 from Medical  Literature	Yuxiao Liang,Pengtao Xie	2020/04/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01862v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than one million individuals all over the world and caused more than 55,000 deaths, as of April 3 in 2020. Radiological findings are important sources of information in guiding the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. However, the existing studies on how radiological findings are correlated with COVID-19 are conducted separately by different hospitals, which may be inconsistent or even conflicting due to population bias. To address this problem, we develop natural language processing methods to analyze a large collection of COVID-19 literature containing study reports from hospitals all over the world, reconcile these results, and draw unbiased and universally-sensible conclusions about the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. We apply our method to the CORD-19 dataset and successfully extract a set of radiological findings that are closely tied to COVID-19.	1185
Analyzing initial stage of COVID-19 transmission through Bayesian  time-varying model	Arkaprava Roy,Sayar Karmakar	2020/04/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02281v4	ArXiv	Recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has affected all of our lives in one way or the other. While medical researchers are working hard to find a cure and doctors/nurses to attend the affected individuals, measures such as `lockdown', `stay-at-home', `social distancing' are being implemented in different parts of the world to curb its further spread. To model the non-stationary spread, we propose a novel time-varying semiparametric AR$(p)$ model for the count valued time-series of newly affected cases, collected every day and also extend it to propose a novel time-varying INGARCH model. Our proposed structures of the models are amenable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for efficient computation. We substantiate our methods by simulations that show superiority compared to some of the close existing methods. Finally we analyze the daily time series data of newly confirmed cases to study its spread through different government interventions.	1186
The Twitter Social Mobility Index: Measuring Social Distancing Practices  from Geolocated Tweets	Paiheng Xu,Mark Dredze,David A. Broniatowski	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02397v2	ArXiv	"Social distancing is an important component of the response to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Minimizing social interactions and travel reduces the rate at which the infection spreads, and ""flattens the curve"" such that the medical system can better treat infected individuals. However, it remains unclear how the public will respond to these policies. This paper presents the Twitter Social Mobility Index, a measure of social distancing and travel derived from Twitter data. We use public geolocated Twitter data to measure how much a user travels in a given week. We find a large reduction in travel in the United States after the implementation of social distancing policies, with larger reductions in states that were early adopters and smaller changes in states without policies. Our findings are presented on http://socialmobility.covid19dataresources.org and we will continue to update our analysis during the pandemic."	1187
Estimating the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of social  distancing in the United States	James Johndrow,Kristian Lum,Maria Gargiulo,Patrick Ball	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02605v2	ArXiv	Understanding the number of individuals who have been infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and the extent to which social distancing policies have been effective at limiting its spread, are critical for effective policy going forward. Here we present estimates of the extent to which confirmed cases in the United States undercount the true number of infections, and analyze how effective social distancing measures have been at mitigating or suppressing the virus. Our analysis uses a Bayesian model of COVID-19 fatalities with a likelihood based on an underlying differential equation model of the epidemic. We provide analysis for four states with significant epidemics: California, Florida, New York, and Washington. Our short-term forecasts suggest that these states may be following somewhat different trajectories for growth of the number of cases and fatalities.	1188
Noisy Pooled PCR for Virus Testing	Junan Zhu,Kristina Rivera,Dror Baron	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02689v1	ArXiv	Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized. Finally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT-PCR experts; it is difficult to form such connections during a pandemic. We welcome new collaborators to reach out and help improve this work!	1189
Discovering associations in COVID-19 related research papers	Iztok Fister Jr.,Karin Fister,Iztok Fister	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03397v1	ArXiv	A COVID-19 pandemic has already proven itself to be a global challenge. It proves how vulnerable humanity can be. It has also mobilized researchers from different sciences and different countries in the search for a way to fight this potentially fatal disease. In line with this, our study analyses the abstracts of papers related to COVID-19 and coronavirus-related-research using association rule text mining in order to find the most interestingness words, on the one hand, and relationships between them on the other. Then, a method, called information cartography, was applied for extracting structured knowledge from a huge amount of association rules. On the basis of these methods, the purpose of our study was to show how researchers have responded in similar epidemic/pandemic situations throughout history.	1190
Word frequency and sentiment analysis of twitter messages during  Coronavirus pandemic	Nikhil Kumar Rajput,Bhavya Ahuja Grover,Vipin Kumar Rathi,Riya Bansal	2020/04/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03925v2	ArXiv	The COVID-19 epidemic has had a great impact on social media conversation, especially on sites like Twitter, which has emerged as a hub for public reaction and information sharing. This paper deals by analyzing a vast dataset of Twitter messages related to this disease, starting from January 2020. Two approaches were used: a statistical analysis of word frequencies and a sentiment analysis to gauge user attitudes. Word frequencies are modeled using unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, with power law distribution as the fitting model. The validity of the model is confirmed through metrics like Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), R-squared ($R^2$), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). High $R^2$ and low SSE/RMSE values indicate a good fit for the model. Sentiment analysis is conducted to understand the general emotional tone of Twitter users messages. The results reveal that a majority of tweets exhibit neutral sentiment polarity, with only 2.57\% expressing negative polarity.	1191
Large Arabic Twitter Dataset on COVID-19	Sarah Alqurashi,Ahmad Alhindi,Eisa Alanazi	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04315v2	ArXiv	The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), emerged late December 2019 in China, is now rapidly spreading across the globe. At the time of writing this paper, the number of global confirmed cases has passed two millions and half with over 180,000 fatalities. Many countries have enforced strict social distancing policies to contain the spread of the virus. This have changed the daily life of tens of millions of people, and urged people to turn their discussions online, e.g., via online social media sites like Twitter. In this work, we describe the first Arabic tweets dataset on COVID-19 that we have been collecting since January 1st, 2020. The dataset would help researchers and policy makers in studying different societal issues related to the pandemic. Many other tasks related to behavioral change, information sharing, misinformation and rumors spreading can also be analyzed.	1192
Mapping county-level mobility pattern changes in the United States in  response to COVID-19	Song Gao,Jinmeng Rao,Yuhao Kang,Yunlei Liang,Jake Kruse	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04544v2	ArXiv	To contain the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, one of the non-pharmacological epidemic control measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak is reducing the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2 in the population through (physical) social distancing. An interactive web-based mapping platform that provides timely quantitative information on how people in different counties and states reacted to the social distancing guidelines was developed with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF). It integrates geographic information systems (GIS) and daily updated human mobility statistical patterns derived from large-scale anonymized and aggregated smartphone location big data at the county-level in the United States, and aims to increase risk awareness of the public, support governmental decision-making, and help enhance community responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.	1193
Deciphering the Protein Motion of S1 Subunit in SARS-CoV-2 Spike  Glycoprotein Through Integrated Computational Methods	Hao Tian,Peng Tao	2020/04/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05256v1	ArXiv	The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major worldwide public health emergency that has infected over $1.5$ million people. The partially open state of S1 subunit in spike glycoprotein is considered vital for its infection with host cell and is represented as a key target for neutralizing antibodies. However, the mechanism elucidating the transition from the closed state to the partially open state still remains unclear. Here, we applied a combination of Markov state model, transition path theory and random forest to analyze the S1 motion. Our results explored a promising complete conformational movement of receptor-binding domain, from buried, partially open, to detached states. We also numerically confirmed the transition probability between those states. Based on the asymmetry in both the dynamics behavior and backbone C$\alpha$ importance, we further suggested a relation between chains in the trimer spike protein, which may help in the vaccine design and antibody neutralization.	1194
Detection of Covid-19 From Chest X-ray Images Using Artificial  Intelligence: An Early Review	Muhammad Ilyas,Hina Rehman,Amine Nait-ali	2020/04/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05436v1	ArXiv	In 2019, the entire world is facing a situation of health emergency due to a newly emerged coronavirus (COVID-19). Almost 196 countries are affected by covid-19, while USA, Italy, China, Spain, Iran, and France have the maximum active cases of COVID-19. The issues, medical and healthcare departments are facing in delay of detecting the COVID-19. Several artificial intelligence based system are designed for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest x-rays. In this article we will discuss the different approaches used for the detection of COVID-19 and the challenges we are facing. It is mandatory to develop an automatic detection system to prevent the transfer of the virus through contact. Several deep learning architecture are deployed for the detection of COVID-19 such as ResNet, Inception, Googlenet etc. All these approaches are detecting the subjects suffering with pneumonia while its hard to decide whether the pneumonia is caused by COVID-19 or due to any other bacterial or fungal attack.	1195
Residual Attention U-Net for Automated Multi-Class Segmentation of  COVID-19 Chest CT Images	Xiaocong Chen,Lina Yao,Yu Zhang	2020/04/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05645v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly around the world and caused significant impact on the public health and economy. However, there is still lack of studies on effectively quantifying the lung infection caused by COVID-19. As a basic but challenging task of the diagnostic framework, segmentation plays a crucial role in accurate quantification of COVID-19 infection measured by computed tomography (CT) images. To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated segmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the Aggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature representation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability of the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a public CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19 Chest CT images. Our study provides a promising deep leaning-based segmentation tool to lay a foundation to quantitative diagnosis of COVID-19 lung infection in CT images.	1196
Modeling, state estimation, and optimal control for the US COVID-19  outbreak	Calvin Tsay,Fernando Lejarza,Mark A. Stadtherr,Michael Baldea	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06291v2	ArXiv	"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 disease have had an unprecedented spread and continue to cause an increasing number of fatalities worldwide. While vaccines are still under development, social distancing, extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that ""on-off"" policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at ""flattening"" the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost."	1197
Abrupt declines in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide over China after the  outbreak of COVID-19	Fei Liu,Aaron Page,Sarah A. Strode,Yasuko Yoshida,Sungyeon Choi,Bo Zheng,Lok N. Lamsal,Can Li,Nickolay A. Krotkov,Henk Eskes,Ronald van der A,Pepijn Veefkind,Pieternel Levelt,Joanna Joiner,Oliver P. Hauser	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06542v1	ArXiv	China's policy interventions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 have environmental and economic impacts. Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide indicates economic activities, as nitrogen dioxide is primarily emitted from fossil fuel consumption. Satellite measurements show a 48% drop in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column densities from the 20 days averaged before the 2020 Lunar New Year to the 20 days averaged after. This is 20% larger than that from recent years. We relate to this reduction to two of the government's actions: the announcement of the first report in each province and the date of a province's lockdown. Both actions are associated with nearly the same magnitude of reductions. Our analysis offers insights into the unintended environmental and economic consequences through reduced economic activities.	1198
Online Information Search During COVID-19	Benjamin Lucas,Brendan Elliot,Todd Landman	2020/04/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07183v2	ArXiv	Public information search data from sources such as Google Trends affords researchers a perspective on what society does not know, or what society wants to find out prompted by, or in response to, developments in societal communication and news media events. In times of crisis, online public information search thus offers a window into the most urgent concerns of, and demands by society. By extension, such data offers a window into upcoming, and currently pressing demands on businesses, policymakers and researchers. This research note aims to illustrate some of these themes with a visual-based overview of the current COVID-19 / Coronavirus crisis.	1199
Extracting the effective contact rate of COVID-19 pandemic	Gaurav Goswami,Jayanti Prasad,Mansi Dhuria	2020/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07750v1	ArXiv	"In the absence of any available vaccines or drugs, prevention of the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being achieved by putting many mitigation measures in place. It is indispensable to have robust and reliable ways of evaluating the effectiveness of these measures. In this work, we assume that, at a very coarse-grained level of description, the overall effect of all the mitigation measures is that we can still describe the spread of the pandemic using the most basic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed ($SEIR$) model but with an ""effective contact rate"" ($\beta$) which is time-dependent. We then use the time series data of the number of infected individuals in the population to extract the instantaneous effective contact rate which is the result of various social interventions put in place. This approach has the potential to be significantly useful while evaluating the impact of mitigation measures on the spread of COVID-19 in near future."	1200
NAIST COVID: Multilingual COVID-19 Twitter and Weibo Dataset	Zhiwei Gao,Shuntaro Yada,Shoko Wakamiya,Eiji Aramaki	2020/04/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08145v1	ArXiv	"Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the late 2019, it has affected over 200 countries and billions of people worldwide. This has affected the social life of people owing to enforcements, such as ""social distancing"" and ""stay at home."" This has resulted in an increasing interaction through social media. Given that social media can bring us valuable information about COVID-19 at a global scale, it is important to share the data and encourage social media studies against COVID-19 or other infectious diseases. Therefore, we have released a multilingual dataset of social media posts related to COVID-19, consisting of microblogs in English and Japanese from Twitter and those in Chinese from Weibo. The data cover microblogs from January 20, 2020, to March 24, 2020. This paper also provides a quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of these datasets by creating daily word clouds as an example of text-mining analysis. The dataset is now available on Github. This dataset can be analyzed in a multitude of ways and is expected to help in efficient communication of precautions related to COVID-19."	1201
A data driven analysis and forecast of an SEIARD epidemic model for  COVID-19 in Mexico	Ugo Avila-Ponce de León,Ángel G. C. Pérez,Eric Avila-Vales	2020/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08288v1	ArXiv	We propose an SEIARD mathematical model to investigate the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Mexico. We conduct a detailed analysis of this model and demonstrate its application using publicly reported data. We calculate the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) via the next-generation matrix method, and we estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported data by minimizing the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak until June 2020. Our results estimate that the peak of the epidemic in Mexico will be around May 2, 2020. Our model incorporates the importance of considering the aysmptomatic infected individuals, because they represent the majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and they could play a huge role in spreading the virus without any knowledge.	1202
Transitioning out of the Coronavirus Lockdown: A Framework for  Zone-Based Social Distancing	Eric Friedman,John Friedman,Simon Johnson,Adam Landsberg	2020/04/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08504v1	ArXiv	In the face of elevated pandemic risk, is it necessary to completely lock down the population, imposing extreme social distancing? Canonical epidemiological models suggest this may be unavoidable for months at a time, despite the heavy social and human cost of physically isolating people. Alternatively, people could retreat into socially or economically defined defensive zones, with more interactions inside their zone than across zones. Starting from a complete lockdown, zones could facilitate responsible reopening of education, government, and firms, as a well-implemented structure can dramatically slow the diffusion of the disease. This paper provides a framework for understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of zones for social distancing.	1203
Monitoring the spread of COVID-19 by estimating reproduction numbers  over time	Thomas Hotz,Matthias Glock,Stefan Heyder,Sebastian Semper,Anne Böhle,Alexander Krämer	2020/04/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08557v1	ArXiv	To control the current outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019, constant monitoring of the epidemic is required since, as of today, no vaccines or antiviral drugs against it are known. We provide daily updated estimates of the reproduction number over time at https://stochastik-tu-ilmenau.github.io/COVID-19/. In this document, we describe the estimator we are using which was developed in (Fraser 2007), derive its asymptotic properties, and we give details on its implementation. Furthermore, we validate the estimator on simulated data, demonstrate that estimates on real data lead to plausible results, and perform a sensitivity analysis. Finally, we discuss why the estimates obtained need to be interpreted with care.	1204
First-principles machine learning modelling of COVID-19	Luca Magri,Nguyen Anh Khoa Doan	2020/04/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09478v1	ArXiv	"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the world since the World Health Organization declared its outbreak on 30th January 2020, recognizing the outbreak as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. As often said by politicians and scientific advisors, the objective is ""to flatten the curve"", or ""push the peak down"", or similar wording, of the virus spreading. Central to the official advice are mathematical models and data, which provide estimates on the evolution of the number of infected, recovered and deaths. The accuracy of the models is improved day by day by inferring the contact, recovery, and death rates from data (confirmed cases). A data-driven model trained with {\it both} data {\it and} first principles is proposed. The model can quickly be re-trained any time that new data becomes available. The method can be applied to more detailed epidemic models with virtually no conceptual modification."	1205
What Types of COVID-19 Conspiracies are Populated by Twitter Bots?	Emilio Ferrara	2020/04/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09531v2	ArXiv	With people moving out of physical public spaces due to containment measures to tackle the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, online platforms become even more prominent tools to understand social discussion. Studying social media can be informative to assess how we are collectively coping with this unprecedented global crisis. However, social media platforms are also populated by bots, automated accounts that can amplify certain topics of discussion at the expense of others. In this paper, we study 43.3M English tweets about COVID-19 and provide early evidence of the use of bots to promote political conspiracies in the United States, in stark contrast with humans who focus on public health concerns.	1206
Fever and mobility data indicate social distancing has reduced incidence  of communicable disease in the United States	Parker Liautaud,Peter Huybers,Mauricio Santillana	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09911v1	ArXiv	In March of 2020, many U.S. state governments encouraged or mandated restrictions on social interactions to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has spread to nearly 180 countries. Estimating the effectiveness of these social-distancing strategies is challenging because surveillance of COVID-19 has been limited, with tests generally being prioritized for high-risk or hospitalized cases according to temporally and regionally varying criteria. Here we show that reductions in mobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a mean lag of 6.5 days ($90\%$ within 3--10 days) that is consistent with the incubation period of COVID-19. Furthermore, counties with larger decreases in mobility subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers ($p<0.01$), with the notable exception of New York City and its immediate vicinity. These results indicate that social distancing has reduced the transmission of influenza like illnesses, including COVID 19, and support social distancing as an effective strategy for slowing the spread of COVID-19.	1207
In the Eyes of the Beholder: Analyzing Social Media Use of Neutral and  Controversial Terms for COVID-19	Long Chen,Hanjia Lyu,Tongyu Yang,Yu Wang,Jiebo Luo	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10225v3	ArXiv	"During the COVID-19 pandemic, ""Chinese Virus"" emerged as a controversial term for coronavirus. To some, it may seem like a neutral term referring to the physical origin of the virus. To many others, however, the term is in fact attaching ethnicity to the virus. While both arguments appear reasonable, quantitative analysis of the term's real-world usage is lacking to shed light on the issues behind the controversy. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap. To model the substantive difference of tweets with controversial terms and those with non-controversial terms, we apply topic modeling and LIWC-based sentiment analysis. To test whether ""Chinese Virus"" and ""COVID-19"" are interchangeable, we formulate it as a classification task, mask out these terms, and classify them using the state-of-the-art transformer models. Our experiments consistently show that the term ""Chinese Virus"" is associated with different substantive topics and sentiment compared with ""COVID-19"" and that the two terms are easily distinguishable by looking at their context."	1208
What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health  Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing	Irene Li,Yixin Li,Tianxiao Li,Sergio Alvarez-Napagao,Dario Garcia-Gasulla,Toyotaro Suzumura	2020/04/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10899v3	ArXiv	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.	1209
Fractional-order susceptible-infected model: definition and applications  to the study of COVID-19 main protease	Luciano Abadias,Gissell Estrada-Rodriguez,Ernesto Estrada	2020/04/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11260v2	ArXiv	We propose a model for the transmission of perturbations across the amino acids of a protein represented as an interaction network. The dynamics consists of a Susceptible-Infected (SI) model based on the Caputo fractional-order derivative. We find an upper bound to the analytical solution of this model which represents the worse-case scenario on the propagation of perturbations across a protein residue network. This upper bound is expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions of the adjacency matrix of the network of inter-amino acids interactions. We then apply this model to the analysis of the propagation of perturbations produced by inhibitors of the main protease of SARS CoV-2. We find that the perturbations produced by strong inhibitors of the protease are propagated far away from the binding site, confirming the long-range nature of intra-protein communication. On the contrary, the weakest inhibitors only transmit their perturbations across a close environment around the binding site. These findings may help to the design of drug candidates against this new coronavirus.	1210
Variation of positiveness to enhance testing of specimens during an  epidemic	Usama Kadri	2020/04/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11753v1	ArXiv	Rapid testing of appropriate specimens from patients suspected for a disease during an epidemic, such as the current Coronavirus outbreak, is of a great importance for the disease management and control. We propose a method to enhance processing large amounts of collected samples. The method is based on mixing samples in testing tubes in a specific configuration, as opposed to testing single samples in each tube, and accounting for natural virus amounts in infected patients from variation of positiveness in test tubes. To illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method we carry out numerical tests for actual scenarios under various tests. Applying the proposed method enhances the number of tests by order of magnitudes, where all positives are identified with no false negatives, and the effective testing time can be reduced drastically even when the uncertainty in the test is relatively high.	1211
Assessing the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on unhappiness,  loneliness, and boredom using Google Trends	Abel Brodeur,Andrew E. Clark,Sarah Fleche,Nattavudh Powdthavee	2020/04/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12129v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic has led many governments to implement lockdowns. While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell. Our results suggest that people's mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown.	1212
A knowledge transfer model for COVID-19 predicting and  non-pharmaceutical intervention simulation	Jingyuan Wang,Xin Lin,Yuxi Liu,Qilegeri,Kai Feng,Hui Lin	2020/04/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12433v2	ArXiv	Since December 2019, A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been breaking out in China, which can cause respiratory diseases and severe pneumonia. Mathematical and empirical models relying on the epidemic situation scale for forecasting disease outbreaks have received increasing attention. Given its successful application in the evaluation of infectious diseases scale, we propose a Susceptible-Undiagnosed-Infected-Removed (SUIR) model to offer the effective prediction, prevention, and control of infectious diseases. Our model is a modified susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that injects undiagnosed state and offers pre-training effective reproduction number. Our SUIR model is more precise than the traditional SIR model. Moreover, we combine domain knowledge of the epidemic to estimate effective reproduction number, which addresses the initial susceptible population of the infectious disease model approach to the ground truth. These findings have implications for the forecasting of epidemic trends in COVID-19 as these could help the growth of estimating epidemic situation.	1213
Anomalous atmospheric circulation favored the spread of COVID-19 in  Europe	Arturo Sanchez-Lorenzo,Javier Vaquero-Martínez,Josep Calbó,Martin Wild,Ana Santurtún,Joan-A. Lopez-Bustins,Jose-M. Vaquero,Doris Folini,Manuel Antón	2020/04/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12503v1	ArXiv	The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is having negative health, social and economic consequences worldwide. In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. It has subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in terms of air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus's propagation, by short-range droplet transmission as well as likely by long-range aerosol (airborne) transmission.	1214
On the Emergence of a Power Law in the Distribution of COVID-19 Cases	Brendan K. Beare,Alexis Akira Toda	2020/04/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12772v2	ArXiv	The first confirmed case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US was reported on January 21, 2020. By the end of March, 2020, there were more than 180000 confirmed cases in the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties. We find that the right tail of this distribution exhibits a power law, with Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model of the growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat's law can explain the emergence of this power law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying lengths of time during which COVID-19 had been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the model generates a power law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of March.	1215
Prevalence of Low-Credibility Information on Twitter During the COVID-19  Outbreak	Kai-Cheng Yang,Christopher Torres-Lugo,Filippo Menczer	2020/04/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14484v2	ArXiv	As the novel coronavirus spreads across the world, concerns regarding the spreading of misinformation about it are also growing. Here we estimate the prevalence of links to low-credibility information on Twitter during the outbreak, and the role of bots in spreading these links. We find that the combined volume of tweets linking to low-credibility information is comparable to the volume of New York Times articles and CDC links. Content analysis reveals a politicization of the pandemic. The majority of this content spreads via retweets. Social bots are involved in both posting and amplifying low-credibility information, although the majority of volume is generated by likely humans. Some of these accounts appear to amplify low-credibility sources in a coordinated fashion.	1216
Identification of an Epidemiological Model to Simulate the COVID-19  Epidemic using Robust Multi-objective Optimization and Stochastic Fractal  Search	Gustavo Barbosa Libotte,Fran Sérgio Lobato,Gustavo Mendes Platt	2020/05/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00289v1	ArXiv	Traditionally, the identification of parameters in the formulation and solution of inverse problems considers that models, variables and mathematical parameters are free of uncertainties. This aspect simplifies the estimation process, but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the design variables in terms of the objective function. In this work, the SIDR (Susceptible, Infected, Dead and Recovered) model is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and its parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem, that is, considering the sensitivity of design variables. For this purpose, a robust multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, considering the minimization of uncertainties associated to the estimation process and the maximization of the robustness parameter. To solve this problem, the Multi-objective Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm is associated with the Effective Mean concept for the evaluation of robustness. The results obtained considering real data of the epidemic in China demonstrate that the evaluation of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results.	1217
Automatic Text Summarization of COVID-19 Medical Research Articles using  BERT and GPT-2	Virapat Kieuvongngam,Bowen Tan,Yiming Niu	2020/06/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01997v1	ArXiv	With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing urgency for medical community to keep up with the accelerating growth in the new coronavirus-related literature. As a result, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge has released a corpus of scholarly articles and is calling for machine learning approaches to help bridging the gap between the researchers and the rapidly growing publications. Here, we take advantage of the recent advances in pre-trained NLP models, BERT and OpenAI GPT-2, to solve this challenge by performing text summarization on this dataset. We evaluate the results using ROUGE scores and visual inspection. Our model provides abstractive and comprehensive information based on keywords extracted from the original articles. Our work can help the the medical community, by providing succinct summaries of articles for which the abstract are not already available.	1218
Mathematical Models for Describing and Predicting the COVID-19 Pandemic  Crisis	P. H. P. Cintra,M. F. Citeli,F. N. Fontinele	2020/06/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02507v1	ArXiv	The present article studies the extension of two deterministic models for describing the novel coronavirus pandemic crisis, the SIR model and the SEIR model. The models were studied and compared to real data in order to support the validity of each description and extract important information regarding the pandemic, such as the basic reproductive number R0, which might provide useful information concerning the rate of increase of the pandemic predicted by each model. We next proceed to making predictions and comparing more complex models derived from the SEIR model with the SIRD model, in order to find the most suitable one for describing and predicting the pandemic crisis. Aiming to answer the question if the simple SIRD model is able to make reliable predictions and deliver suitable information compared to more complex models.	1219
On the dynamics of the Coronavirus epidemic and the unreported cases:  the Chilean case	Andrés Navas,Gastón Vergara-Hermosilla	2020/06/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02632v1	ArXiv	We analyze the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic taking into account the role of the unreported cases. After a first section in which we deal with a framework of very slow test capacity, we turn to the model recently introduced/implemented by Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb. First, we prove some basic structural results for the corresponding ODE, as for instance the convergence of S(t) to a positive limit. These are similar to those of the classical SIR model, although the maxima of the corresponding curves are not necessarily unique. Finally, we implement the model -- but with a variable transmission rate -- in the Chilean context. A key parameter adjustment (namely, the fraction of unreported cases) is done via an argument using mortality rates. We conclude with several conclusions and lines of future research.	1220
An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach to Assess the ZIP Code Level  Impact of COVID-19 in NYC	Fadoua Khmaissia,Pegah Sagheb Haghighi,Aarthe Jayaprakash,Zhenwei Wu,Sokratis Papadopoulos,Yuan Lai,Freddy T. Nguyen	2020/06/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08361v3	ArXiv	New York City has been recognized as the world's epicenter of the novel Coronavirus pandemic. To identify the key inherent factors that are highly correlated to the Increase Rate of COVID-19 new cases in NYC, we propose an unsupervised machine learning framework. Based on the assumption that ZIP code areas with similar demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility patterns are likely to experience similar outbreaks, we select the most relevant features to perform a clustering that can best reflect the spread, and map them down to 9 interpretable categories. We believe that our findings can guide policy makers to promptly anticipate and prevent the spread of the virus by taking the right measures.	1221
A small molecule drug candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease	Mohsen Chitsaz	2020/06/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09125v2	ArXiv	A new coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought the world to a state of crisis, causing a major pandemic, claiming more than 433,000 lives and instigating major financial damage to the global economy. Despite current efforts, developing safe and effective treatments remains a major challenge. Moreover, new strains of the virus are likely to emerge in the future. To prevent future pandemics, several drugs with various mechanisms of action are required. Drug discovery efforts against the virus fall into two main categories: (a) monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the virus and blocking it from entry; (b) small molecule inhibitors targeting key proteins of the virus, interfering with replication and translation of the virus. In this study, we are presenting a computational investigation of a potential drug candidate that targets SARS-CoV-2 protease, a viral protein critical for replication and translation of the virus.	1222
Effective immunity and second waves: a dynamic causal modelling study	Karl J. Friston,Thomas Parr,Peter Zeidman,Adeel Razi,Guillaume Flandin,Jean Daunizeau,Oliver J. Hulme,Alexander J. Billig,Vladimir Litvak,Cathy J. Price,Rosalyn J. Moran,Anthony Costello,Deenan Pillay,Christian Lambert	2020/06/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09429v1	ArXiv	This technical report addresses a pressing issue in the trajectory of the coronavirus outbreak; namely, the rate at which effective immunity is lost following the first wave of the pandemic. This is a crucial epidemiological parameter that speaks to both the consequences of relaxing lockdown and the propensity for a second wave of infections. Using a dynamic causal model of reported cases and deaths from multiple countries, we evaluated the evidence models of progressively longer periods of immunity. The results speak to an effective population immunity of about three months that, under the model, defers any second wave for approximately six months in most countries. This may have implications for the window of opportunity for tracking and tracing, as well as for developing vaccination programmes, and other therapeutic interventions.	1223
The Weather Impacts the Outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China	Siyu Huang,Ji Liu,Haoyi Xiong,Jizhou Huang,Haozhe An,Dejing Dou	2020/06/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10376v1	ArXiv	Recent literature has suggested that climate conditions have considerably significant influences on the transmission of coronavirus COVID-19. However, there is a lack of comprehensive study that investigates the relationships between multiple weather factors and the development of COVID-19 pandemic while excluding the impact of social factors. In this paper, we study the relationships between six main weather factors and the infection statistics of COVID-19 on 250 cities in Mainland China. Our correlation analysis using weather and infection statistics indicates that all the studied weather factors are correlated with the spread of COVID-19, where precipitation shows the strongest correlation. We also build a weather-aware predictive model that forecasts the number of infected cases should there be a second wave of the outbreak in Mainland China. Our predicted results show that cities located in different geographical areas are likely to be challenged with the second wave of COVID-19 at very different time periods and the severity of the outbreak varies to a large degree, in correspondence with the varying weather conditions.	1224
The Economic Costs of Containing a Pandemic	Asahi Noguchi	2020/06/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11750v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused one of the most serious social and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time, there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt, which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future generations.	1225
Risk Communication in Asian Countries: COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter	Sungkyu Park,Sungwon Han,Jeongwook Kim,Mir Majid Molaie,Hoang Dieu Vu,Karandeep Singh,Jiyoung Han,Wonjae Lee,Meeyoung Cha	2020/06/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12218v3	ArXiv	COVID-19 has become one of the most widely talked about topics on social media. This research characterizes risk communication patterns by analyzing the public discourse on the novel coronavirus from four Asian countries: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India, which suffered the outbreak to different degrees. The temporal analysis shows that the official epidemic phases issued by governments do not match well with the online attention on COVID-19. This finding calls for a need to analyze the public discourse by new measures, such as topical dynamics. Here, we propose an automatic method to detect topical phase transitions and compare similarities in major topics across these countries over time. We examine the time lag difference between social media attention and confirmed patient counts. For dynamics, we find an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topical diversity.	1226
Impacts of COVID-19 control measures on tropospheric NO$_2$ over China,  South Korea and Italy	Jiaqi Chen,Zhe Jiang,Kazuyuki Miyazaki,Rui Zhu,Xiaokang Chen,Chenggong Liao,Dylan B. A. Jones,Kevin Bowman,Takashi Sekiya	2020/06/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12858v1	ArXiv	Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) concentrations are strongly affected by anthropogenic activities. Using space-based measurements of tropospheric NO$_2$, here we investigate the responses of tropospheric NO$_2$ to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) over China, South Korea, and Italy. We find noticeable reductions of tropospheric NO$_2$ columns due to the COVID-19 controls by more than 40% over E. China, South Korea, and N. Italy. The 40% reductions of tropospheric NO$_2$ are coincident with intensive lockdown events as well as up to 20% reductions in anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NO$_x$) emissions. The perturbations in tropospheric NO$_2$ diminished accompanied with the mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic, and finally disappeared within around 50-70 days after the starts of control measures over all three nations, providing indications for the start, maximum, and mitigation of intensive controls. This work exhibits significant influences of lockdown measures on atmospheric environment, highlighting the importance of satellite observations to monitor anthropogenic activity changes.	1227
How do Agile Software Startups deal with uncertainties by Covid-19  pandemic?	Rafael da Camara,Marcelo Marinho,Suzana Sampaio,Saulo Cadete	2020/06/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13715v3	ArXiv	The dissipation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a couple of weeks. The evolution of the disease and its economic impact is highly uncertain, which brings challenges for newly created software companies. Software startups are companies that create innovative software products and services in a dynamic and fast-growing market. Agile Software Methods aims to enable startups in responding to uncertainty caused by Covid-19. This paper investigates the impact of Covid-19 in a real software startup context to understand how they have reacted against uncertainties caused by Covid-19. As a research methodology, action research within Di2Win, a Brazilian software startup, has been applied. The study was carried out throughout six sprints, during the quarantine. Practices employed to mitigate threats while simultaneously allowing teams to remain open to opportunities and challenges are detailed. This paper shares lessons learned that could help agile software startups improve their way of work in an uncertain environment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.	1228
Document Classification for COVID-19 Literature	Bernal Jiménez Gutiérrez,Juncheng Zeng,Dongdong Zhang,Ping Zhang,Yu Su	2020/06/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13816v2	ArXiv	The global pandemic has made it more important than ever to quickly and accurately retrieve relevant scientific literature for effective consumption by researchers in a wide range of fields. We provide an analysis of several multi-label document classification models on the LitCovid dataset, a growing collection of 23,000 research papers regarding the novel 2019 coronavirus. We find that pre-trained language models fine-tuned on this dataset outperform all other baselines and that BioBERT surpasses the others by a small margin with micro-F1 and accuracy scores of around 86% and 75% respectively on the test set. We evaluate the data efficiency and generalizability of these models as essential features of any system prepared to deal with an urgent situation like the current health crisis. Finally, we explore 50 errors made by the best performing models on LitCovid documents and find that they often (1) correlate certain labels too closely together and (2) fail to focus on discriminative sections of the articles; both of which are important issues to address in future work. Both data and code are available on GitHub.	1229
Data-driven Analytical Models of COVID-2019 for Epidemic Prediction,  Clinical Diagnosis, Policy Effectiveness and Contact Tracing: A Survey	Ying Mao,Susiyan Jiang,Daniel Nametz,Yuxin Lin,Jake Hack,John Hensley,Ryan Monaghan,Tess Gutenbrunner	2020/06/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13994v2	ArXiv	The widely spread CoronaVirus Disease (COVID)-19 is one of the worst infectious disease outbreaks in history and has become an emergency of primary international concern. As the pandemic evolves, academic communities have been actively involved in various capacities, including accurate epidemic estimation, fast clinical diagnosis, policy effectiveness evaluation and development of contract tracing technologies. There are more than 23,000 academic papers on the COVID-19 outbreak, and this number is doubling every 20 days while the pandemic is still on-going [1]. The literature, however, at its early stage, lacks a comprehensive survey from a data analytics perspective. In this paper, we review the latest models for analyzing COVID19 related data, conduct post-publication model evaluations and cross-model comparisons, and collect data sources from different projects.	1230
Heterogeneous impact of a lockdown on inter-municipality mobility	H. P. M. Melo,J. Henriques,R. Carvalho,T. Verma,J. P. da Cruz,N. A. M. Araujo	2020/06/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15724v1	ArXiv	Without a vaccine, the fight against the spreading of the coronavirus has focused on maintaining physical distance. To study the impact of such measures on inter-municipality traffic, we analyze a mobile dataset with the daily flow of people in Portugal in March and April 2020. We find that the reduction in inter-municipality traffic depends strongly on its initial outflow. In municipalities where the mobility is low, the outflow reduced by $10-20\%$ and this decrease was independent of the population size. Whereas, for municipalities of high mobility, the reduction was a monotonic increasing function of the population size and it even exceeded $60\%$ for the largest municipalities. As a consequence of such heterogeneities, there were significant structural changes on the most probable paths for the spreading of the virus, which must be considered when modeling the impact of control measures.	1231
Answering Questions on COVID-19 in Real-Time	Jinhyuk Lee,Sean S. Yi,Minbyul Jeong,Mujeen Sung,Wonjin Yoon,Yonghwa Choi,Miyoung Ko,Jaewoo Kang	2020/06/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15830v2	ArXiv	The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the world and researchers are struggling to effectively combat it. One reason why the fight is difficult is due to the lack of information and knowledge. In this work, we outline our effort to contribute to shrinking this knowledge vacuum by creating covidAsk, a question answering (QA) system that combines biomedical text mining and QA techniques to provide answers to questions in real-time. Our system also leverages information retrieval (IR) approaches to provide entity-level answers that are complementary to QA models. Evaluation of covidAsk is carried out by using a manually created dataset called COVID-19 Questions which is based on information from various sources, including the CDC and the WHO. We hope our system will be able to aid researchers in their search for knowledge and information not only for COVID-19, but for future pandemics as well.	1232
Estimating the real burden of disease under a pandemic situation: The  SARS-CoV2 case	Amanda Fernández-Fontelo,David Moriña,Alejandra Cabaña,Argimiro Arratia,Pere Puig	2020/08/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00262v1	ArXiv	The present paper introduces a new model used to study and analyse the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) epidemic-reported-data from Spain. This is a Hidden Markov Model whose hidden layer is a regeneration process with Poisson immigration, Po-INAR(1), together with a mechanism that allows the estimation of the under-reporting in non-stationary count time series. A novelty of the model is that the expectation of the innovations in the unobserved process is a time-dependent function defined in such a way that information about the spread of an epidemic, as modelled through a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed dynamical system, is incorporated into the model. In addition, the parameter controlling the intensity of the under-reporting is also made to vary with time to adjust to possible seasonality or trend in the data. Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate the parameters of the model.	1233
Anxiety for the pandemic and trust in financial markets	Roy Cerqueti,Valerio Ficcadenti	2020/08/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01649v1	ArXiv	"The COVID-19 pandemic has generated disruptive changes in many fields. Here we focus on the relationship between the anxiety felt by people during the pandemic and the trust in the future performance of financial markets. Precisely, we move from the idea that the volume of Google searches about ""coronavirus"" can be considered as a proxy of the anxiety and, jointly with the stock index prices, can be used to produce mood indicators -- in terms of pessimism and optimism -- at country level. We analyse the ""very high human developed countries"" according to the Human Development Index plus China and their respective main stock market indexes. Namely, we propose both a temporal and a global measure of pessimism and optimism and provide accordingly a classification of indexes and countries. The results show the existence of different clusters of countries and markets in terms of pessimism and optimism. Moreover, specific regimes along the time emerge, with an increasing optimism spreading during the mid of June 2020. Furthermore, countries with different government responses to the pandemic have experienced different levels of mood indicators, so that countries with less strict lockdown had a higher level of optimism."	1234
FaceOff: Detecting Face Touching with a Wrist-Worn Accelerometer	Xiang 'Anthony' Chen	2020/08/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01769v1	ArXiv	According to the CDC, one key step of preventing oneself from contracting coronavirus (COVID-19) is to avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. However, touching one's face is a frequent and spontaneous behavior---one study observed subjects touching their faces on average 23 times per hour. Creative solutions have emerged amongst some recent commercial and hobbyists' projects, yet most either are closed-source or lack validation in performance. We develop FaceOff---a sensing technique using a commodity wrist-worn accelerometer to detect face-touching behavior based on the specific motion pattern of raising one's hand towards the face. We report a survey (N=20) that elicits different ways people touch their faces, an algorithm that temporally ensembles data-driven models to recognize when a face touching behavior occurs and results from a preliminary user testing (N=3 for a total of about 90 minutes).	1235
Aggression in the workplace makes social distance difficult	Keisuke Kokubun	2020/08/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04131v2	ArXiv	The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections continues to increase. The practice of social distance attracts attention as a measure to prevent the spread of infection, but it is difficult for some occupations. Therefore, in previous studies, the scale of factors that determine social distance has been developed. However, it was not clear how to select the items among them, and it seemed to be somewhat arbitrary. In response to this trend, this paper extracted eight scales by performing exploratory factor analysis based on certain rules while eliminating arbitrariness as much as possible. They were Adverse Conditions, Leadership, Information Processing, Response to Aggression, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal Teamwork. Of these, Adverse Conditions, Response to Aggression, and Horizontal Teamwork had a positive correlation with Physical Proximity, and Information Processing, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, and Communication with the Outside had a negative correlation with Physical Proximity. Furthermore, as a result of multiple regression analysis, it was shown that Response to Aggression, not the mere teamwork assumed in previous studies, had the greatest influence on Physical Proximity.	1236
COVID19 Tracking: An Interactive Tracking, Visualizing and Analyzing  Platform	Zhou Yang,Jiwei Xu,Zhenhe Pan,Fang Jin	2020/08/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04285v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now become a pandemic, inflicting millions of people and causing tens of thousands of deaths. To better understand the dynamics of COVID-19, we present a comprehensive COVID-19 tracking and visualization platform that pinpoints the dynamics of the COVID-19 worldwide. Four essential components are implemented: 1) presenting the visualization map of COVID-19 confirmed cases and total counts all over the world; 2) showing the worldwide trends of COVID-19 at multi-grained levels; 3) provide multi-view comparisons, including confirmed cases per million people, mortality rate and accumulative cure rate; 4) integrating a multi-grained view of the disease spreading dynamics in China and showing how the epidemic is taken under control in China.	1237
A Spatial Stochastic SIR Model for Transmission Networks with  Application to COVID-19 Epidemic in China	Tatsushi Oka,Wei Wei,Dan Zhu	2020/08/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06051v2	ArXiv	Governments around the world have implemented preventive measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, we consider a multivariate discrete-time Markov model to analyze the propagation of COVID-19 across 33 provincial regions in China. This approach enables us to evaluate the effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread of the disease. We use data on daily human mobility across regions and apply the Bayesian framework to estimate the proposed model. The results show that the spread of the disease in China was predominately driven by community transmission within regions and the lockdown policy introduced by local governments curbed the spread of the pandemic. Further, we document that Hubei was only the epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters, such as Beijing and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020, and the disease spread out to connected regions. The transmission from these epicenters substantially declined following the introduction of human mobility restrictions across regions.	1238
No COVID-19 Climate Silver Lining in the US Power Sector	Max Luke,Priyanshi Somani,Turner Cotterman,Dhruv Suri,Stephen J. Lee	2020/08/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06660v2	ArXiv	Recent studies conclude that the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic decreased power sector CO$_2$ emissions globally and in the United States. In this paper, we analyze the statistical significance of CO2 emissions reductions in the U.S. power sector from March through December 2020. We use Gaussian process (GP) regression to assess whether CO2 emissions reductions would have occurred with reasonable probability in the absence of COVID-19 considering uncertainty due to factors unrelated to the pandemic and adjusting for weather, seasonality, and recent emissions trends. We find that monthly CO2 emissions reductions are only statistically significant in April and May 2020 considering hypothesis tests at 5% significance levels. Separately, we consider the potential impact of COVID-19 on coal-fired power plant retirements through 2022. We find that only a small percentage of U.S. coal power plants are at risk of retirement due to a possible COVID-19-related sustained reduction in electricity demand and prices. We observe and anticipate a return to pre-COVID-19 CO2 emissions in the U.S. power sector.	1239
SEIRD model in heterogenous populations: The role of commuting and  social inequalities in the COVID-19 dynamics	João A. M. Gondim,Thiago Yukio Tanaka	2020/08/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06718v1	ArXiv	In this paper we analyze the effects of commuting and social inequalities for the epidemic development of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). With this aim we consider a SEIRD (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and dead by disease) model without vital dynamics in a population divided into patches that have different economic resources and in which the individuals can commute from one patch to another (bilaterally). In the modeling we choose the social and commuting parameters arbitrarily. We calculate the basic reproductive number $R_0$ with the next generation approach and analyze the sensitivity of $R_0$ with respect to the parameters. Furthermore, we run numerical simulations considering a population divided into two patches to bring some conclusions on the number of total infected individuals and cumulative deaths for our model considering heterogeneous populations.	1240
Corona-Warn-App: Tracing the Start of the Official COVID-19 Exposure  Notification App for Germany	Jens Helge Reelfs,Oliver Hohlfeld,Ingmar Poese	2020/07/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07370v1	ArXiv	"On June 16, 2020, Germany launched an open-source smartphone contact tracing app (""Corona-Warn-App"") to help tracing SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) infection chains. It uses a decentralized, privacy-preserving design based on the Exposure Notification APIs in which a centralized server is only used to distribute a list of keys of SARS-CoV-2 infected users that is fetched by the app once per day. Its success, however, depends on its adoption. In this poster, we characterize the early adoption of the app using Netflow traces captured directly at its hosting infrastructure. We show that the app generated traffic from allover Germany---already on the first day. We further observe that local COVID-19 outbreaks do not result in noticeable traffic increases."	1241
Multiscale statistical physics of the Human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome	Arsham Ghavasieh,Sebastiano Bontorin,Oriol Artime,Manlio De Domenico	2020/08/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09649v1	ArXiv	Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have been used to investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins on the function of human cells, laying out a deeper understanding of COVID--19 and providing ground for drug repurposing strategies. However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each system's state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.	1242
Numerical Analysis of a Highly Sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance  Sensor for SARS-CoV-2 Detection	Syed Mohammad Ashab Uddin,Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury,Ehsan Kabir	2020/08/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10354v1	ArXiv	In this paper, we propose a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) structure based on Kretschmann configuration incorporating layers of Silicon and BaTiO$_3$ on top of Ag for real-time detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using thiol tethered DNA as a ligand. Extensive numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor response considering sensitivity, full width at half maxima, and minimum reflection. About 7.6 times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to the basic Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed. As a result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for highly sensitive, rapid, non-invasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in experimental sensing protocols.	1243
Data Mining Approach to Analyze Covid19 Dataset of Brazilian Patients	Josimar E. Chire Saire	2020/08/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11344v1	ArXiv	The pandemic originated by coronavirus(covid-19), name coined by World Health Organization during the first month in 2020. Actually, almost all the countries presented covid19 positive cases and governments are choosing different health policies to stop the infection and many research groups are working on patients data to understand the virus, at the same time scientists are looking for a vacuum to enhance imnulogy system to tack covid19 virus. One of top countries with more infections is Brazil, until August 11 had a total of 3,112,393 cases. Research Foundation of Sao Paulo State(Fapesp) released a dataset, it was an innovative in collaboration with hospitals(Einstein, Sirio-Libanes), laboratory(Fleury) and Sao Paulo University to foster reseach on this trend topic. The present paper presents an exploratory analysis of the datasets, using a Data Mining Approach, and some inconsistencies are found, i.e. NaN values, null references values for analytes, outliers on results of analytes, encoding issues. The results were cleaned datasets for future studies, but at least a 20\% of data were discarded because of non numerical, null values and numbers out of reference range.	1244
Twitter Interaction to Analyze Covid-19 Impact in Ghana, Africa from  March to July	Josimar Chire Saire,Kobby Panford-Quainoo	2020/08/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12277v2	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has impacted various aspects of the world from tourism, business, education, and many more. Like for every country, the global pandemic has imposed similar effects on Ghana. During this period, citizens of this country have used social networks as a platform to find and disseminate information about the infectious disease and also share their own opinions and sentiments. In this study, we use text mining to draw insights from data collected from the social network, Twitter. Our exploration of the data led us to understand the most frequent topics raised in the Greater Accra region of Ghana from March to July 2020. We observe that the engagement of users of this social network was initially high in March but declined from April to July. The reason was probably that the people were becoming more adapted to the situation after an initial shock when the disease was announced in the country. We also found certain words in these tweets of users that enabled us to understand the sentiments and mental state of individuals at the time.	1245
Featuring ACE2 binding SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through a conserved  evolutionary pattern of amino acid residues	Patrícia P. D. Carvalho,Nelson A. Alves	2020/08/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12830v2	ArXiv	Spike (S) glycoproteins mediate the coronavirus entry into the host cell. The S1 subunit of S-proteins contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is able to recognize different host receptors, highlighting its remarkable capacity to adapt to their hosts along the viral evolution. While RBD in spike proteins is determinant for the virus-receptor interaction, the active residues lie at the receptor-binding motif (RBM), a region located in RBD that plays a fundamental role binding the outer surface of their receptors. Here, we address the hypothesis that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins have adapted their RBM along the viral evolution to explore specific conformational topology driven by the residues YGF to infect host cells. We also speculate that this YGF-based mechanism can act as a protein signature located at the RBM to distinguish coronaviruses able to use ACE2 as a cell entry receptor.	1246
Analysis, Modeling, and Representation of COVID-19 Spread: A Case Study  on India	Rahul Mishra,Hari Prabhat Gupta,Tanima Dutta	2020/08/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13116v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus outbreak is one of the most challenging pandemics for the entire human population of the planet Earth. Techniques such as the isolation of infected persons and maintaining social distancing are the only preventive measures against the epidemic COVID-19. The actual estimation of the number of infected persons with limited data is an indeterminate problem faced by data scientists. There are a large number of techniques in the existing literature, including reproduction number, the case fatality rate, etc., for predicting the duration of an epidemic and infectious population. This paper presents a case study of different techniques for analysing, modeling, and representation of data associated with an epidemic such as COVID-19. We further propose an algorithm for estimating infection transmission states in a particular area. This work also presents an algorithm for estimating end-time of an epidemic from Susceptible Infectious and Recovered model. Finally, this paper presents empirical and data analysis to study the impact of transmission probability, rate of contact, infectious, and susceptible on the epidemic spread.	1247
Effectiveness of the COVID-19 Contact-Confirming Application (COCOA)  based on a Multi Agent Simulation	Yuto Omae,Jun Toyotani,Kazuyuki Hara,Yasuhiro Gon,Hirotaka Takahashi	2020/08/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13166v1	ArXiv	"As of Aug. 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still spreading in the world. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare developed ""COVID-19 Contact-Confirming Application (COCOA),"" which was released on Jun. 19, 2020. By utilizing COCOA, users can know whether or not they had contact with infected persons. If those who had contact with infectors keep staying at home, they may not infect those outside. However, effectiveness decreasing the number of infectors depending on the app's various usage parameters is not clear. If it is clear, we could set the objective value of the app's usage parameters (e.g., the usage rate of the total populations) and call for installation of the app. Therefore, we develop a multi-agent simulator that can express COVID-19 spreading and usage of the apps, such as COCOA. In this study, we describe the simulator and the effectiveness of the app in various scenarios. The result obtained in this study supports those of previously conducted studies."	1248
Phonemer at WNUT-2020 Task 2: Sequence Classification Using COVID  Twitter BERT and Bagging Ensemble Technique based on Plurality Voting	Anshul Wadhawan	2020/10/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00294v3	ArXiv	This paper presents the approach that we employed to tackle the EMNLP WNUT-2020 Shared Task 2 : Identification of informative COVID-19 English Tweets. The task is to develop a system that automatically identifies whether an English Tweet related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is informative or not. We solve the task in three stages. The first stage involves pre-processing the dataset by filtering only relevant information. This is followed by experimenting with multiple deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs and Transformer based models. In the last stage, we propose an ensemble of the best model trained on different subsets of the provided dataset. Our final approach achieved an F1-score of 0.9037 and we were ranked sixth overall with F1-score as the evaluation criteria.	1249
"Containing a pandemic: Nonpharmaceutical interventions and the ""second  wave"""	Michael te Vrugt,Jens Bickmann,Raphael Wittkowski	2020/09/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00962v1	ArXiv	"In response to the worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as face masks and social distancing have been implemented. A careful assessment of the effects of such containment strategies is required to avoid exceeding social and economical costs as well as a dangerous ""second wave"" of the pandemic. In this work, we combine a recently developed dynamical density functional theory model and an extended SIRD model with hysteresis to study effects of various measures and strategies using realistic parameters. Depending on intervention thresholds, a variety of phases with different numbers of shutdowns and deaths are found. Spatiotemporal simulations provide further insights into the dynamics of a second wave. Our results are of crucial importance for public health policy."	1250
Possibility to create a coronavirus sensor using an optically excited  electrical signal	Ognyan Ivanov,Peter Todorov,Zhivko Stoyanov	2020/08/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01965v1	ArXiv	The research of our team has led to a series of new experimental results, revealing the so-called electromagnetic echo effect (EMEE). The EMEE signal is highly sensitive even to small changes in the composition and properties of the object under study - gas, liquid, or solid. The method is fast and contactless, provides real-time analysis, and can be considered universal. We have an idea to create a sensor to detect COVID-19 in three cases -- in the air, on hard surfaces, and in fluids from the human body. The approach involves detecting specific reactions to the virus, even if they are invisible without specialized equipment. Our experience shows that the EMEE signal is very sensitive to weak or practically imperceptible reactions. Therefore, we believe that it is quite possible to register the presence of COVID-19. We have many experimental results in this regard that support this idea. We have experience in creating sensors to monitor the processes, composition, and properties of fluids (including biological ones), as well as to detect pollution and contamination in the atmosphere.	1251
Pay Attention to the cough: Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 using  Interpretable Symptoms Embeddings with Cough Sound Signal Processing	Ankit Pal,Malaikannan Sankarasubbu	2020/10/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02417v2	ArXiv	COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a treacherous and devastating catastrophe for humanity. At the time of writing, no specific antivirus drugs or vaccines are recommended to control infection transmission and spread. The current diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by Reverse-Transcription Polymer Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and not easily available in straitened regions. An interpretable and COVID-19 diagnosis AI framework is devised and developed based on the cough sounds features and symptoms metadata to overcome these limitations. The proposed framework's performance was evaluated using a medical dataset containing Symptoms and Demographic data of 30000 audio segments, 328 cough sounds from 150 patients with four cough classes ( COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, and Healthy). Experiments' results show that the model captures the better and robust feature embedding to distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with higher specificity and accuracy of 95.04 $\pm$ 0.18% and 96.83$\pm$ 0.18% respectively, all the while maintaining interpretability.	1252
Contact Graph Epidemic Modelling of COVID-19 for Transmission and  Intervention Strategies	Abby Leung,Xiaoye Ding,Shenyang Huang,Reihaneh Rabbany	2020/10/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03081v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly become a global public health crisis unseen in recent years. It is known that the structure of the human contact network plays an important role in the spread of transmissible diseases. In this work, we study a structure aware model of COVID-19 CGEM. This model becomes similar to the classical compartment-based models in epidemiology if we assume the contact network is a Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph, i.e. everyone comes into contact with everyone else with the same probability. In contrast, CGEM is more expressive and allows for plugging in the actual contact networks, or more realistic proxies for it. Moreover, CGEM enables more precise modelling of enforcing and releasing different non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies. Through a set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant differences between the epidemic curves when assuming different underlying structures. More specifically we demonstrate that the compartment-based models are overestimating the spread of the infection by a factor of 3, and under some realistic assumptions on the compliance factor, underestimating the effectiveness of some of NPIs, mischaracterizing others (e.g. predicting a later peak), and underestimating the scale of the second peak after reopening.	1253
Rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 with functionalized magnetic  nanoparticles	Jing Zhong,Enja Laureen Roesch,Thilo Viereck,Meinhard Schilling,Frank Ludwig	2020/10/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03886v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global medical systems and economies, and rules our daily living life. Controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become one of the most important and urgent strategies throughout the whole world. As of October, 2020, there have not yet been any medicines or therapies to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, rapid and sensitive diagnostics is the most important measures to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Homogeneous biosensing based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is one of the most promising approaches for rapid and highly sensitive detection of biomolecules. This paper proposes an approach for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 with functionalized MNPs via the measurement of their magnetic response in an ac magnetic field. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows the rapid detection of mimic SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 0.084 nM (5.9 fmole). The proposed approach has great potential for designing a low-cost and point-of-care device for rapid and sensitive diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.	1254
Ensemble Machine Learning Methods for Modeling COVID19 Deaths	R. Bathwal,P. Chitta,K. Tirumala,V. Varadarajan	2020/10/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04052v1	ArXiv	Using a hybrid of machine learning and epidemiological approaches, we propose a novel data-driven approach in predicting US COVID-19 deaths at a county level. The model gives a more complete description of the daily death distribution, outputting quantile-estimates instead of mean deaths, where the model's objective is to minimize the pinball loss on deaths reported by the New York Times coronavirus county dataset. The resulting quantile estimates accurately forecast deaths at an individual-county level for a variable-length forecast period, and the approach generalizes well across different forecast period lengths. We won the Caltech-run modeling competition out of 50+ teams, and our aggregate is competitive with the best COVID-19 modeling systems (on root mean squared error).	1255
EDNA-Covid: A Large-Scale Covid-19 Tweets Dataset Collected with the  EDNA Streaming Toolkit	Abhijit Suprem,Calton Pu	2020/10/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04084v2	ArXiv	The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered many facets of our lives. With nationwide lockdowns and stay-at-home advisories, conversations about the pandemic have naturally moved to social networks, e.g. Twitter. This affords an unprecedented insight into the evolution of social discourse in the presence of a long-running destabilizing factor such as a pandemic with the high-volume, high-velocity, high-noise Covid-19 Twitter feed. However, real-time information extraction from such a data stream requires a fault-tolerant streaming infrastructure to perform the non-trivial integration of heterogenous data sources from news organizations, social feeds, and authoritative medical organizations like the CDC. To address this, we present (i) the EDNA streaming toolkit for consuming and processing streaming data, and (ii) EDNA-Covid, a multilingual, large-scale dataset of coronavirus-related tweets collected with EDNA since January 25, 2020. EDNA-Covid includes, at time of this publication, over 600M tweets from around the world in over 10 languages. We release both the EDNA toolkit and the EDNA-Covid dataset to the public so that they can be used to extract valuable insights on this extraordinary social event.	1256
Modeling the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco	Houssine Zine,El Mehdi Lotfi,Marouane Mahrouf,Adnane Boukhouima,Yassine Aqachmar,Khalid Hattaf,Delfim F. M. Torres,Noura Yousfi	2020/10/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04115v1	ArXiv	Nowadays, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health and economy worldwide. Unfortunately, there is yet no effective drug for this disease. For this, several countries have adopted multiple preventive interventions to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Here, we propose a delayed mathematical model to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco. Parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis of the proposed model are rigorously studied. Moreover, numerical simulations are presented in order to test the effectiveness of the preventive measures and strategies that were imposed by the Moroccan authorities and also help policy makers and public health administration to develop such strategies.	1257
SLEDGE-Z: A Zero-Shot Baseline for COVID-19 Literature Search	Sean MacAvaney,Arman Cohan,Nazli Goharian	2020/10/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05987v1	ArXiv	With worldwide concerns surrounding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a rapidly growing body of scientific literature on the virus. Clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers need to be able to search these articles effectively. In this work, we present a zero-shot ranking algorithm that adapts to COVID-related scientific literature. Our approach filters training data from another collection down to medical-related queries, uses a neural re-ranking model pre-trained on scientific text (SciBERT), and filters the target document collection. This approach ranks top among zero-shot methods on the TREC COVID Round 1 leaderboard, and exhibits a P@5 of 0.80 and an nDCG@10 of 0.68 when evaluated on both Round 1 and 2 judgments. Despite not relying on TREC-COVID data, our method outperforms models that do. As one of the first search methods to thoroughly evaluate COVID-19 search, we hope that this serves as a strong baseline and helps in the global crisis.	1258
Analytical parameter estimation of the SIR epidemic model. Applications  to the COVID-19 pandemic	Dimiter Prodanov	2020/10/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07000v1	ArXiv	The dramatic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics and its ongoing progression boosted the scientific community's interest in epidemic modeling and forecasting. The SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model is a simple mathematical model of epidemic outbreaks, yet for decades it evaded the efforts of the community to derive an explicit solution. The present work demonstrates that this is a non-trivial task. Notably, it is proven that the explicit solution of the model requires the introduction of a new transcendental special function, related to the Wright's Omega function. The present manuscript reports new analytical results and numerical routines suitable for parametric estimation of the SIR model. The manuscript introduces iterative algorithms approximating the incidence variable, which allows for estimation of the model parameters from the numbers of observed cases. The numerical approach is exemplified with data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for several European countries in the period Jan 2020 -- Jun 2020.	1259
Survive the Schema Changes: Integration of Unmanaged Data Using Deep  Learning	Zijie Wang,Lixi Zhou,Amitabh Das,Valay Dave,Zhanpeng Jin,Jia Zou	2020/10/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07586v1	ArXiv	Data is the king in the age of AI. However data integration is often a laborious task that is hard to automate. Schema change is one significant obstacle to the automation of the end-to-end data integration process. Although there exist mechanisms such as query discovery and schema modification language to handle the problem, these approaches can only work with the assumption that the schema is maintained by a database. However, we observe diversified schema changes in heterogeneous data and open data, most of which has no schema defined. In this work, we propose to use deep learning to automatically deal with schema changes through a super cell representation and automatic injection of perturbations to the training data to make the model robust to schema changes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for two real-world data integration scenarios: coronavirus data integration, and machine log integration.	1260
Drink Bleach or Do What Now? Covid-HeRA: A Study of Risk-Informed Health  Decision Making in the Presence of COVID-19 Misinformation	Arkin Dharawat,Ismini Lourentzou,Alex Morales,ChengXiang Zhai	2020/10/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08743v2	ArXiv	Given the widespread dissemination of inaccurate medical advice related to the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), such as fake remedies, treatments and prevention suggestions, misinformation detection has emerged as an open problem of high importance and interest for the research community. Several works study health misinformation detection, yet little attention has been given to the perceived severity of misinformation posts. In this work, we frame health misinformation as a risk assessment task. More specifically, we study the severity of each misinformation story and how readers perceive this severity, i.e., how harmful a message believed by the audience can be and what type of signals can be used to recognize potentially malicious fake news and detect refuted claims. To address our research questions, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, accompanied by detailed data analysis. We evaluate several traditional and state-of-the-art models and show there is a significant gap in performance when applying traditional misinformation classification models to this task. We conclude with open challenges and future directions.	1261
CHECKED: Chinese COVID-19 Fake News Dataset	Chen Yang,Xinyi Zhou,Reza Zafarani	2020/10/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09029v2	ArXiv	COVID-19 has impacted all lives. To maintain social distancing and avoiding exposure, works and lives have gradually moved online. Under this trend, social media usage to obtain COVID-19 news has increased. Also, misinformation on COVID-19 is frequently spread on social media. In this work, we develop CHECKED, the first Chinese dataset on COVID-19 misinformation. CHECKED provides a total 2,104 verified microblogs related to COVID-19 from December 2019 to August 2020, identified by using a specific list of keywords. Correspondingly, CHECKED includes 1,868,175 reposts, 1,185,702 comments, and 56,852,736 likes that reveal how these verified microblogs are spread and reacted on Weibo. The dataset contains a rich set of multimedia information for each microblog including ground-truth label, textual, visual, temporal, and network information. Extensive experiments have been conducted to analyze CHECKED data and to provide benchmark results for well-established methods when predicting fake news using CHECKED. We hope that CHECKED can facilitate studies that target misinformation on coronavirus. The dataset is available at https://github.com/cyang03/CHECKED.	1262
Disinformation in the Online Information Ecosystem: Detection,  Mitigation and Challenges	Amrita Bhattacharjee,Kai Shu,Min Gao,Huan Liu	2020/10/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09113v1	ArXiv	With the rapid increase in access to internet and the subsequent growth in the population of online social media users, the quality of information posted, disseminated and consumed via these platforms is an issue of growing concern. A large fraction of the common public turn to social media platforms and in general the internet for news and even information regarding highly concerning issues such as COVID-19 symptoms. Given that the online information ecosystem is extremely noisy, fraught with misinformation and disinformation, and often contaminated by malicious agents spreading propaganda, identifying genuine and good quality information from disinformation is a challenging task for humans. In this regard, there is a significant amount of ongoing research in the directions of disinformation detection and mitigation. In this survey, we discuss the online disinformation problem, focusing on the recent 'infodemic' in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. We then proceed to discuss the inherent challenges in disinformation research, and then elaborate on the computational and interdisciplinary approaches towards mitigation of disinformation, after a short overview of the various directions explored in detection efforts.	1263
Synthesis of COVID-19 Chest X-rays using Unpaired Image-to-Image  Translation	Hasib Zunair,A. Ben Hamza	2020/10/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10266v1	ArXiv	Motivated by the lack of publicly available datasets of chest radiographs of positive patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we build the first-of-its-kind open dataset of synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images of high fidelity using an unsupervised domain adaptation approach by leveraging class conditioning and adversarial training. Our contributions are twofold. First, we show considerable performance improvements on COVID-19 detection using various deep learning architectures when employing synthetic images as additional training set. Second, we show how our image synthesis method can serve as a data anonymization tool by achieving comparable detection performance when trained only on synthetic data. In addition, the proposed data generation framework offers a viable solution to the COVID-19 detection in particular, and to medical image classification tasks in general. Our publicly available benchmark dataset consists of 21,295 synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The insights gleaned from this dataset can be used for preventive actions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.	1264
When to Relax Social Distancing Measures? An ARIMA Based Forecasting  Study	Ramya Hariharan	2020/10/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10587v1	ArXiv	The spread of the novel coronavirus across various countries is wide and rapid. The number of confirmed cases and the reproduction number are some of the epidemiological parameters utilized in scientific studies for the analysis and prediction of the viral transmission. The positive rate, an indicator on the extent of testing the population, aids in understanding the severity of the infection in a given geographic location. The positive rate for selected countries has been considered in this study to construct ARIMA based statistical models. The goodness of fit of the models are verified by the investigation of residuals, Box-Luang test and the forecast error values. The positive rates forecasted by the ARIMA models are utilized to investigate the scope for implementation of relaxations in social distancing measures in some countries and the necessity to tighten the rules further in some other countries.	1265
Assessing the Impact of Social Network Structure on the Diffusion of  Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Generalized Spatial SEIRD Model	Giorgio Fagiolo	2020/10/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11212v1	ArXiv	In this paper, I study epidemic diffusion in a generalized spatial SEIRD model, where individuals are initially connected in a social or geographical network. As the virus spreads in the network, the structure of interactions between people may endogenously change over time, due to quarantining measures and/or spatial-distancing policies. I explore via simulations the dynamic properties of the co-evolutionary process dynamically linking disease diffusion and network properties. Results suggest that, in order to predict how epidemic phenomena evolve in networked populations, it is not enough to focus on the properties of initial interaction structures. Indeed, the co-evolution of network structures and compartment shares strongly shape the process of epidemic diffusion, especially in terms of its speed. Furthermore, I show that the timing and features of spatial-distancing policies may dramatically influence their effectiveness.	1266
E-Commerce Delivery Demand Modeling Framework for An Agent-Based  Simulation Platform	Takanori Sakai,Yusuke Hara,Ravi Seshadri,André Alho,Md Sami Hasnine,Peiyu Jing,ZhiYuan Chua,Moshe Ben-Akiva	2020/10/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14375v1	ArXiv	The e-commerce delivery demand has grown rapidly in the past two decades and such trend has accelerated tremendously due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Given the situation, the need for predicting e-commerce delivery demand and evaluating relevant logistics solutions is increasing. However, the existing simulation models for e-commerce delivery demand are still limited and do not consider the delivery options and their attributes that shoppers face on e-commerce order placements. We propose a novel modeling framework which jointly predicts the average total value of e-commerce purchase, the purchase amount per transaction, and delivery option choices. The proposed framework can simulate the changes in e-commerce delivery demand attributable to the changes in delivery options. We assume the model parameters based on various sources of relevant information and conduct a demonstrative sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we have applied the model to the simulation for the Auto-Innovative Prototype city. While the calibration of the model using real-world survey data is required, the result of the analysis highlights the applicability of the proposed framework.	1267
Modeling epidemics through ladder operators	F. Bagarello,F. Gargano,F. Roccati	2020/10/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14898v1	ArXiv	We propose a simple model of spreading of some infection in an originally healthy population which is different from other models existing in the literature. In particular, we use an operator technique which allows us to describe in a natural way the possible interactions between healthy and un-healthy populations, and their transformation into recovered and to dead people. After a rather general discussion, we apply our method to the analysis of Chinese data for the SARS-2003 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-1) and the Coronavirus COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease; SARS-CoV-2 ) and we show that the model works very well in reproducing the long-time behaviour of the disease, and in particular in finding the number of affected and dead people in the limit of large time. Moreover, we show how the model can be easily modified to consider some lockdown measure, and we deduce that this procedure drastically reduces the asymptotic value of infected individuals, as expected, and observed in real life.	1268
Bayesian Nonparametric Dimensionality Reduction of Categorical Data for  Predicting Severity of COVID-19 in Pregnant Women	Marzieh Ajirak,Cassandra Heiselman,Anna Fuchs,Mia Heiligenstein,Kimberly Herrera,Diana Garretto,Petar Djuric	2020/11/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03715v2	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world and while pregnant women present the same adverse outcome rates, they are underrepresented in clinical research. We collected clinical data of 155 test-positive COVID-19 pregnant women at Stony Brook University Hospital. Many of these collected data are of multivariate categorical type, where the number of possible outcomes grows exponentially as the dimension of data increases. We modeled the data within the unsupervised Bayesian framework and mapped them into a lower-dimensional space using latent Gaussian processes. The latent features in the lower dimensional space were further used for predicting if a pregnant woman would be admitted to a hospital due to COVID-19 or would remain with mild symptoms. We compared the prediction accuracy with the dummy/one-hot encoding of categorical data and found that the latent Gaussian process had better accuracy.	1269
Clinical Landscape of COVID-19 Testing: Difficult Choices	Darshan Gandhi,Sanskruti Landage,Joseph Bae,Sheshank Shankar,Rohan Sukumaran,Parth Patwa,Sethuraman T V,Priyanshi Katiyar,Shailesh Advani,Rohan Iyer,Sunaina Anand,Aryan Mahindra,Rachel Barbar,Abhishek Singh,Ramesh Raskar	2020/11/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04202v2	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across the world, leading to enormous amounts of human death and economic loss. Until definitive preventive or curative measures are developed, policies regarding testing, contact tracing, and quarantine remain the best public health tools for curbing viral spread. Testing is a crucial component of these efforts, enabling the identification and isolation of infected individuals. Differences in testing methodologies, time frames, and outcomes can have an impact on their overall efficiency, usability and efficacy. In this early draft, we draw a comparison between the various types of diagnostic tests including PCR, antigen, and home tests in relation to their relative advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. We also look into alternative and unconventional methods. Further, we analyze the short-term and long-term impacts of the virus and its testing on various verticals such as business, government laws, policies, and healthcare.	1270

This data article provides a dataset of daily updates of COVID-19 as reported online by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from February 27, 2020 to September 29, 2020. The data were obtained through web scraping from different sources and it includes some economic variables such as the Nigeria budget for each state in 2020, population estimate, healthcare facilities, and the COVID-19 laboratories in Nigeria. The dataset has been processed using the standard of the FAIR data principle which encourages its findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability and will be relevant to researchers in different fields such as Data Science, Epidemiology, Earth Modelling, and Health Informatics.	1271
Comprehensive Assessment of COVID-19 Impact on Saskatchewan Power System  Operations	Nima Safari,George Price,C. Y. Chung	2020/11/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10844v1	ArXiv	This paper presents lessons learned to date during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from the viewpoint of Saskatchewan power system operations. A load estimation approach is developed to identify how the closures affecting businesses, schools, and other non-critical businesses due to COVID-19 changed the electricity consumption. Furthermore, the impacts of COVID-19 containment measures and re-opening phases on load uncertainty are examined. Changes in CO2 emissions resulting from an increased proportion of renewable energy generation and the change in load pattern are discussed. In addition, the influence of COVID-19 on the balancing authority's power control performance is investigated. Analyses conducted in the paper are based upon data from SaskPower corporation, which is the principal electric utility in Saskatchewan, Canada. Some recommendations for future power system operation and planning are developed.	1272
Dank or Not? -- Analyzing and Predicting the Popularity of Memes on  Reddit	Kate Barnes,Tiernon Riesenmy,Minh Duc Trinh,Eli Lleshi,Nóra Balogh,Roland Molontay	2020/11/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14326v2	ArXiv	Internet memes have become an increasingly pervasive form of contemporary social communication that attracted a lot of research interest recently. In this paper, we analyze the data of 129,326 memes collected from Reddit in the middle of March, 2020, when the most serious coronavirus restrictions were being introduced around the world. This article not only provides a looking glass into the thoughts of Internet users during the COVID-19 pandemic but we also perform a content-based predictive analysis of what makes a meme go viral. Using machine learning methods, we also study what incremental predictive power image related attributes have over textual attributes on meme popularity. We find that the success of a meme can be predicted based on its content alone moderately well, our best performing machine learning model predicts viral memes with AUC=0.68. We also find that both image related and textual attributes have significant incremental predictive power over each other.	1273
Audio, Speech, Language, & Signal Processing for COVID-19: A  Comprehensive Overview	Gauri Deshpande,Björn W. Schuller	2020/11/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14445v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been the research focus world-wide in the year 2020. Several efforts, from collection of COVID-19 patients' data to screening them for the virus's detection are taken with rigour. A major portion of COVID-19 symptoms are related to the functioning of the respiratory system, which in-turn critically influences the human speech production system. This drives the research focus towards identifying the markers of COVID-19 in speech and other human generated audio signals. In this paper, we give an overview of the speech and other audio signal, language and general signal processing-based work done using Artificial Intelligence techniques to screen, diagnose, monitor, and spread the awareness aboutCOVID-19. We also briefly describe the research related to detect accord-ing COVID-19 symptoms carried out so far. We aspire that this collective information will be useful in developing automated systems, which can help in the context of COVID-19 using non-obtrusive and easy to use modalities such as audio, speech, and language.	1274
The bat coronavirus RmYN02 is characterized by a 6-nucleotide deletion  at the S1/S2 junction, and its claimed PAA insertion is highly doubtful	Yuri Deigin,Rossana Segreto	2020/12/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00627v1	ArXiv	Zhou et al. reported the discovery of RmYN02, a strain closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which is claimed to contain a natural PAA amino acid insertion at the S1/S2 junction of the spike protein at the same position of the PRRA insertion that has created a polybasic furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2. The authors support with their findings the theory that the furin cleavage site insertion present in SARS-CoV-2 is natural. Because no nucleotide alignment with closely related strains of the region coding for the supposed insertion is provided by Zhou et al., we have applied several alignment algorithms to search for the most parsimonious alignments. We conclude that RmYN02 does not contain an insertion at the S1/S2 junction when compared to its closest relatives at the nucleotide level, but rather a 6-nucleotide deletion and that the claimed PAA insertion is more likely to be the result of mutations. A close examination of RmYN02 sequencing records and assembly methods is wishful. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2, with its 12-nucleotide insertion at the S1/S2 junction remains unique among its sarbecovirus relatives.	1275
New results on the asymptotic behavior of an SIS epidemiological model  with quarantine strategy, stochastic transmission, and Lévy disturbance	Driss Kiouach,Yassine Sabbar,Salim El Azami El-idrissi	2020/12/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00875v1	ArXiv	The spread of infectious diseases is a major challenge in our contemporary world, especially after the recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The quarantine strategy is one of the important intervention measures to control the spread of an epidemic by greatly minimizing the likelihood of contact between infected and susceptible individuals. In this study, we analyze the impact of various stochastic disturbances on the epidemic dynamics during the quarantine period. For this purpose, we present an SIQS epidemic model that incorporates the stochastic transmission and the L\'evy noise in order to simulate both small and massive perturbations. Under appropriate conditions, some interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: ergodicity, persistence in the mean, and extinction of the disease. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the stochastic noises. Our work improves many existing studies in the field of mathematical epidemiology and provides new techniques to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of epidemics.	1276
Statistical techniques to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality  rate	Mikael Mieskolainen,Robert Bainbridge,Oliver Buchmueller,Louis Lyons,Nicholas Wardle	2020/11/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02100v1	ArXiv	"The determination of the infection fatality rate (IFR) for the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a key aim for many of the field studies that are currently being undertaken in response to the pandemic. The IFR together with the basic reproduction number $R_0$, are the main epidemic parameters describing severity and transmissibility of the virus, respectively. The IFR can be also used as a basis for estimating and monitoring the number of infected individuals in a population, which may be subsequently used to inform policy decisions relating to public health interventions and lockdown strategies. The interpretation of IFR measurements requires the calculation of confidence intervals. We present a number of statistical methods that are relevant in this context and develop an inverse problem formulation to determine correction factors to mitigate time-dependent effects that can lead to biased IFR estimates. We also review a number of methods to combine IFR estimates from multiple independent studies, provide example calculations throughout this note and conclude with a summary and ""best practice"" recommendations. The developed code is available online."	1277
Design aspects of COVID-19 treatment trials: Improving probability and  time of favourable events	Jan Beyersmann,Tim Friede,Claudia Schmoor	2020/11/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02103v1	ArXiv	As a reaction to the pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a multitude of clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 or the resulting corona disease (COVID-19) are globally at various stages from planning to completion. Although some attempts were made to standardize study designs, this was hindered by the ferocity of the pandemic and the need to set up trials quickly. We take the view that a successful treatment of COVID-19 patients (i) increases the probability of a recovery or improvement within a certain time interval, say 28 days; (ii) aims to expedite favourable events within this time frame; and (iii) does not increase mortality over this time period. On this background we discuss the choice of endpoint and its analysis. Furthermore, we consider consequences of this choice for other design aspects including sample size and power and provide some guidance on the application of adaptive designs in this particular context.	1278
Recent Advances in Computer Audition for Diagnosing COVID-19: An  Overview	Kun Qian,Bjorn W. Schuller,Yoshiharu Yamamoto	2020/12/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04650v1	ArXiv	Computer audition (CA) has been demonstrated to be efficient in healthcare domains for speech-affecting disorders (e.g., autism spectrum, depression, or Parkinson's disease) and body sound-affecting abnormalities (e. g., abnormal bowel sounds, heart murmurs, or snore sounds). Nevertheless, CA has been underestimated in the considered data-driven technologies for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. In this light, summarise the most recent advances in CA for COVID-19 speech and/or sound analysis. While the milestones achieved are encouraging, there are yet not any solid conclusions that can be made. This comes mostly, as data is still sparse, often not sufficiently validated and lacking in systematic comparison with related diseases that affect the respiratory system. In particular, CA-based methods cannot be a standalone screening tool for SARS-CoV-2. We hope this brief overview can provide a good guidance and attract more attention from a broader artificial intelligence community.	1279
A Critique of the Google Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) Framework	Jaap-Henk Hoepman	2020/12/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05097v2	ArXiv	As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic digital contact tracing has been proposed as a tool to support the health authorities in their quest to determine who has been in close and sustained contact with a person infected by the coronavirus. In April 2020 Google and Apple released the Google Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework, as a decentralised and more privacy friendly platform for contact tracing. The GAEN framework implements exposure notification mostly at the operating system layer, instead of fully at the app(lication) layer. In this paper we study the consequences of this approach. We argue that this creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance at the operating system layer. We show how it does not technically prevent the health authorities from implementing a purely centralised form of contact tracing (even though that is the stated aim). We highlight that GAEN allows Google and Apple to dictate how contact tracing is (or rather isn't) implemented in practice by health authorities, and how it introduces the risk of function creep.	1280
A modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model for observed  under-reported incidence data	Imelda Trejo,Nicolas Hengartner	2020/12/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05294v2	ArXiv	Fitting Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models to incidence data is problematic when not all infected individuals are reported. Assuming an underlying SIR model with general but known distribution for the time to recovery, this paper derives the implied differential-integral equations for observed incidence data when a fixed fraction of newly infected individuals are not observed. The parameters of the resulting system of differential equations are identifiable. Using these differential equations, we develop a stochastic model for the conditional distribution of current disease incidence given the entire past history of reported cases. We estimate the model parameters using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution. We use our model to estimate the transmission rate and fraction of asymptomatic individuals for the current Coronavirus 2019 outbreak in eight American Countries: the United States of America, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Panama, from January 2020 to May 2021. Our analysis reveals that consistently, about 40-60% of the infections were not observed in the American outbreaks. The two exception are Mexico and Peru, with acute under-reporting in Mexico.	1281
User Questions from Tweets on COVID-19: An Exploratory Study	Tiago de Melo	2020/11/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05836v1	ArXiv	Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide a suitable avenue for users (people or patients) concerned on health questions to discuss and share information with each other. In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease cases were first reported in China. Soon after, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a state of emergency due to the rapid spread of the virus in other parts of the world. In this work, we used automated extraction of COVID-19 discussion from Twitter and a natural language processing (NLP) method based on topic modeling to discover the main questions related to COVID-19 from tweets. Moreover, we created a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify the main entities of four different categories: disease, drug, person, and organization. Our findings can help policy makers and health care organizations to understand the issues of people on COVID-19 and it can be used to address them appropriately.	1282
g2tmn at Constraint@AAAI2021: Exploiting CT-BERT and Ensembling Learning  for COVID-19 Fake News Detection	Anna Glazkova,Maksim Glazkov,Timofey Trifonov	2020/12/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11967v3	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on various areas of human life. Hence, the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences are being actively discussed on social media. However, not all social media posts are truthful. Many of them spread fake news that cause panic among readers, misinform people and thus exacerbate the effect of the pandemic. In this paper, we present our results at the Constraint@AAAI2021 Shared Task: COVID-19 Fake News Detection in English. In particular, we propose our approach using the transformer-based ensemble of COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT) models. We describe the models used, the ways of text preprocessing and adding extra data. As a result, our best model achieved the weighted F1-score of 98.69 on the test set (the first place in the leaderboard) of this shared task that attracted 166 submitted teams in total.	1283
Mining user reviews of COVID contact-tracing apps: An exploratory  analysis of nine European apps	Vahid Garousi,David Cutting,Michael Felderer	2020/12/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13589v1	ArXiv	"Context: More than 50 countries have developed COVID contact-tracing apps to limit the spread of coronavirus. However, many experts and scientists cast doubt on the effectiveness of those apps. For each app, a large number of reviews have been entered by end-users in app stores. Objective: Our goal is to gain insights into the user reviews of those apps, and to find out the main problems that users have reported. Our focus is to assess the ""software in society"" aspects of the apps, based on user reviews. Method: We selected nine European national apps for our analysis and used a commercial app-review analytics tool to extract and mine the user reviews. For all the apps combined, our dataset includes 39,425 user reviews. Results: Results show that users are generally dissatisfied with the nine apps under study, except the Scottish (""Protect Scotland"") app. Some of the major issues that users have complained about are high battery drainage and doubts on whether apps are really working. Conclusion: Our results show that more work is needed by the stakeholders behind the apps (e.g., app developers, decision-makers, public health experts) to improve the public adoption, software quality and public perception of these apps."	1284
Survey of the Detection and Classification of Pulmonary Lesions via CT  and X-Ray	Yixuan Sun,Chengyao Li,Qian Zhang,Aimin Zhou,Guixu Zhang	2020/12/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15442v1	ArXiv	In recent years, the prevalence of several pulmonary diseases, especially the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has attracted worldwide attention. These diseases can be effectively diagnosed and treated with the help of lung imaging. With the development of deep learning technology and the emergence of many public medical image datasets, the diagnosis of lung diseases via medical imaging has been further improved. This article reviews pulmonary CT and X-ray image detection and classification in the last decade. It also provides an overview of the detection of lung nodules, pneumonia, and other common lung lesions based on the imaging characteristics of various lesions. Furthermore, this review introduces 26 commonly used public medical image datasets, summarizes the latest technology, and discusses current challenges and future research directions.	1285
Validating Optimal COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Models	Mahzabeen Emu,Dhivya Chandrasekaran,Vijay Mago,Salimur Choudhury	2021/02/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04251v1	ArXiv	With the approval of vaccines for the coronavirus disease by many countries worldwide, most developed nations have begun, and developing nations are gearing up for the vaccination process. This has created an urgent need to provide a solution to optimally distribute the available vaccines once they are received by the authorities. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based solution to select optimal distribution centers and a Constraint Satisfaction Problem framework to optimally distribute the vaccines taking into consideration two factors namely priority and distance. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed models using real-world data obtained from the district of Chennai, India. The model provides the decision making authorities with optimal distribution centers across the district and the optimal allocation of individuals across these distribution centers with the flexibility to accommodate a wide range of demographics.	1286
Benchmarking Deep Graph Generative Models for Optimizing New Drug  Molecules for COVID-19	Logan Ward,Jenna A. Bilbrey,Sutanay Choudhury,Neeraj Kumar,Ganesh Sivaraman	2021/02/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04977v1	ArXiv	Design of new drug compounds with target properties is a key area of research in generative modeling. We present a small drug molecule design pipeline based on graph-generative models and a comparison study of two state-of-the-art graph generative models for designing COVID-19 targeted drug candidates: 1) a variational autoencoder-based approach (VAE) that uses prior knowledge of molecules that have been shown to be effective for earlier coronavirus treatments and 2) a deep Q-learning method (DQN) that generates optimized molecules without any proximity constraints. We evaluate the novelty of the automated molecule generation approaches by validating the candidate molecules with drug-protein binding affinity models. The VAE method produced two novel molecules with similar structures to the antiretroviral protease inhibitor Indinavir that show potential binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 protein target 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-protease).	1287
Towards reliable and transparent vaccine phase III trials with smart  contracts	Ivan da Silva Sendin,Rodrigo Sanches Miani	2021/02/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07022v1	ArXiv	Transforming a vaccine concept into a real vaccine product is a complicated process and includes finding suitable antigens and regulatory, technical, and manufacturing obstacles. A relevant issue within this scope is the clinical trial process. Monitoring and ensuring the integrity of trial data using the traditional system is not always feasible. The search for a vaccine against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 illustrates this situation. The scientific credibility of findings from several vaccines' clinical trials contributed to distorted perceptions concerning the benefits and risks of the drug. This scenario is ideal for applying technologies such as Blockchain and Smart Contracts in healthcare issues. This paper proposes a protocol based on Smart Contracts, named VaccSC, to enable transparency, accounting, and confidentiality to Phase III of vaccine experiments. The protocol was implemented in Solidity language, and results show that the VaccSC enables double-blindness, randomization, and the auditability of clinical data, even in the presence of dishonest participants.	1288
Characterizing the Landscape of COVID-19 Themed Cyberattacks and  Defenses	Mir Mehedi Ahsan Pritom,Kristin M. Schweitzer,Raymond M. Bateman,Min Xu,Shouhuai Xu	2021/02/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13223v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 (Coronavirus) hit the global society and economy with a big surprise. In particular, work-from-home has become a new norm for employees. Despite the fact that COVID-19 can equally attack innocent people and cybercriminals, it is ironic to see surges in cyberattacks leveraging COVID-19 as a theme, dubbed COVID-19 themed cyberattacks or COVID-19 attacks for short, which represent a new phenomenon that has yet to be systematically understood. In this paper, we make the first step towards fully characterizing the landscape of these attacks, including their sophistication via the Cyber Kill Chain model. We also explore the solution space of defenses against these attacks.	1289
Drug Recommendation System based on Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews  using Machine Learning	Satvik Garg	2021/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01113v2	ArXiv	Since coronavirus has shown up, inaccessibility of legitimate clinical resources is at its peak, like the shortage of specialists, healthcare workers, lack of proper equipment and medicines. The entire medical fraternity is in distress, which results in numerous individuals demise. Due to unavailability, people started taking medication independently without appropriate consultation, making the health condition worse than usual. As of late, machine learning has been valuable in numerous applications, and there is an increase in innovative work for automation. This paper intends to present a drug recommender system that can drastically reduce specialists heap. In this research, we build a medicine recommendation system that uses patient reviews to predict the sentiment using various vectorization processes like Bow, TFIDF, Word2Vec, and Manual Feature Analysis, which can help recommend the top drug for a given disease by different classification algorithms. The predicted sentiments were evaluated by precision, recall, f1score, accuracy, and AUC score. The results show that classifier LinearSVC using TFIDF vectorization outperforms all other models with 93% accuracy.	1290
Detection of COVID-19 Disease using Deep Neural Networks with Ultrasound  Imaging	Carlos Rojas-Azabache,Karen Vilca-Janampa,Renzo Guerrero-Huayta,Dennis Núñez-Fernández	2021/04/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01509v2	ArXiv	The new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019) has rapidly become a pandemic and has had a devastating effect on both everyday life, public health and the global economy. It is critical to detect positive cases as early as possible to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to treat affected patients quickly. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as accurate automated tool kits are not available. This paper presents a work in progress that proposes the analysis of images of lung ultrasound scans using a convolutional neural network. The trained model will be used on a Raspberry Pi to predict on new images.	1291
A Generalized Unscented Transformation for Probability Distributions	Donald Ebeigbe,Tyrus Berry,Michael M. Norton,Andrew J. Whalen,Dan Simon,Timothy Sauer,Steven J. Schiff	2021/04/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01958v2	ArXiv	The unscented transform uses a weighted set of samples called sigma points to propagate the means and covariances of nonlinear transformations of random variables. However, unscented transforms developed using either the Gaussian assumption or a minimum set of sigma points typically fall short when the random variable is not Gaussian distributed and the nonlinearities are substantial. In this paper, we develop the generalized unscented transform (GenUT), which uses 2n+1 sigma points to accurately capture up to the diagonal components of the skewness and kurtosis tensors of most probability distributions. Constraints can be analytically enforced on the sigma points while guaranteeing at least second-order accuracy. The GenUT uses the same number of sigma points as the original unscented transform while also being applicable to non-Gaussian distributions, including the assimilation of observations in the modeling of infectious diseases such as coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19.	1292
In-Line Image Transformations for Imbalanced, Multiclass Computer Vision  Classification of Lung Chest X-Rays	Alexandrea K. Ramnarine	2021/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02238v1	ArXiv	Artificial intelligence (AI) is disrupting the medical field as advances in modern technology allow common household computers to learn anatomical and pathological features that distinguish between healthy and disease with the accuracy of highly specialized, trained physicians. Computer vision AI applications use medical imaging, such as lung chest X-Rays (LCXRs), to facilitate diagnoses by providing second-opinions in addition to a physician's or radiologist's interpretation. Considering the advent of the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, LCXRs may provide rapid insights to indirectly aid in infection containment, however generating a reliably labeled image dataset for a novel disease is not an easy feat, nor is it of highest priority when combating a global pandemic. Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to select features that distinguish between healthy and disease states for other lung pathologies; this study aims to leverage that body of literature in order to apply image transformations that would serve to balance the lack of COVID-19 LCXR data. Furthermore, this study utilizes a simple CNN architecture for high-performance multiclass LCXR classification at 94 percent accuracy.	1293
Evaluation of Time Series Forecasting Models for Estimation of PM2.5  Levels in Air	Satvik Garg,Himanshu Jindal	2021/04/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03226v1	ArXiv	Air contamination in urban areas has risen consistently over the past few years. Due to expanding industrialization and increasing concentration of toxic gases in the climate, the air is getting more poisonous step by step at an alarming rate. Since the arrival of the Coronavirus pandemic, it is getting more critical to lessen air contamination to reduce its impact. The specialists and environmentalists are making a valiant effort to gauge air contamination levels. However, its genuinely unpredictable to mimic subatomic communication in the air, which brings about off base outcomes. There has been an ascent in using machine learning and deep learning models to foresee the results on time series data. This study adopts ARIMA, FBProphet, and deep learning models such as LSTM, 1D CNN, to estimate the concentration of PM2.5 in the environment. Our predicted results convey that all adopted methods give comparative outcomes in terms of average root mean squared error. However, the LSTM outperforms all other models with reference to mean absolute percentage error.	1294
The spatial dissemination of COVID-19 and associated socio-economic  consequences	Yafei Zhang,Lin Wang,Jonathan J. H. Zhu,Xiaofan Wang	2021/04/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08213v2	ArXiv	The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide with millions of lives claimed, human travel restricted and economic development halted. Leveraging city-level mobility and case data, our analysis shows that the spatial dissemination of COVID-19 can be well explained by a local diffusion process in the mobility network rather than a global diffusion process, indicating the effectiveness of the implemented disease prevention and control measures. Based on the constructed case prediction model, it is estimated that there could be distinct social consequences if the COVID-19 outbreak happened in different areas. During the epidemic control period, human mobility experienced substantial reductions and the mobility network underwent remarkable local and global structural changes toward containing the spread of COVID-19. Our work has important implications for the mitigation of disease and the evaluation of the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on society.	1295
Comparison of remote experiments using crowdsourcing and laboratory  experiments on speech intelligibility	Ayako Yamamoto,Toshio Irino,Kenichi Arai,Shoko Araki,Atsunori Ogawa,Keisuke Kinoshita,Tomohiro Nakatani	2021/04/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10001v1	ArXiv	Many subjective experiments have been performed to develop objective speech intelligibility measures, but the novel coronavirus outbreak has made it very difficult to conduct experiments in a laboratory. One solution is to perform remote testing using crowdsourcing; however, because we cannot control the listening conditions, it is unclear whether the results are entirely reliable. In this study, we compared speech intelligibility scores obtained in remote and laboratory experiments. The results showed that the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the remote experiments' speech reception threshold (SRT) were higher than those of the laboratory experiments. However, the variance in the SRTs across the speech-enhancement conditions revealed similarities, implying that remote testing results may be as useful as laboratory experiments to develop an objective measure. We also show that the practice session scores correlate with the SRT values. This is a priori information before performing the main tests and would be useful for data screening to reduce the variability of the SRT distribution.	1296
Algorithm as Experiment: Machine Learning, Market Design, and Policy  Eligibility Rules	Yusuke Narita,Kohei Yata	2021/04/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12909v6	ArXiv	Algorithms make a growing portion of policy and business decisions. We develop a treatment-effect estimator using algorithmic decisions as instruments for a class of stochastic and deterministic algorithms. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal for well-defined causal effects. A special case of our setup is multidimensional regression discontinuity designs with complex boundaries. We apply our estimator to evaluate the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which allocated many billions of dollars worth of relief funding to hospitals via an algorithmic rule. The funding is shown to have little effect on COVID-19-related hospital activities. Naive estimates exhibit selection bias.	1297
Child-Robot Interaction Studies During COVID-19 Pandemic	Pinar Uluer,Hatice Kose,Agnieszka Landowska,Tatjana Zorcec,Ben Robins,Duygun Erol Barkana	2021/05/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00215v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic affected our lives deeply, just like everyone else, the children also suffered from the restrictions due to COVID-19 affecting their education and social interactions with others, being restricted from play areas and schools for a long time. Although social robots provide a promising solution to support children in their education, healthcare and social interaction with others, the precautions due to COVID-19 also introduced new constraints in the social robotics research. In this paper, we will discuss the benefits and challenges encountered in child-robot interaction due to COVID-19 based on two user studies. The first study involves children with hearing disabilities, and Pepper humanoid robot to support their audiometry tests. The second study includes the child-sized humanoid robot Kaspar and interaction games with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).	1298
An application of discrete-time SEIR model to the COVID-19 spread	U. A. Rozikov,S. K. Shoyimardonov	2021/05/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00238v1	ArXiv	The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is applied in several countries to ascertain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We consider discrete-time SEIR epidemic model in a closed system which does not account for births or deaths, total population size under consideration is constant. This dynamical system generated by a non-linear evolution operator depending on four parameters. Under some conditions on parameters we reduce the evolution operator to a quadratic stochastic operator (QSO) which maps 3-dimensional simplex to itself. We show that the QSO has uncountable set of fixed points (all laying on the boundary of the simplex). It is shown that all trajectories of the dynamical system (generated by the QSO) of the SEIR model are convergent (i.e. the QSO is regular). Moreover, we discuss the efficiency of the model for Uzbekistan.	1299
COUnty aggRegation mixup AuGmEntation (COURAGE) COVID-19 Prediction	Siawpeng Er,Shihao Yang,Tuo Zhao	2021/05/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00620v2	ArXiv	The global spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has cast a significant threat to mankind. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, predicting localized disease severity is crucial for advanced resource allocation. This paper proposes a method named COURAGE (COUnty aggRegation mixup AuGmEntation) to generate a short-term prediction of 2-week-ahead COVID-19 related deaths for each county in the United States, leveraging modern deep learning techniques. Specifically, our method adopts a self-attention model from Natural Language Processing, known as the transformer model, to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies within the time series while enjoying computational efficiency. Our model fully utilizes publicly available information of COVID-19 related confirmed cases, deaths, community mobility trends and demographic information, and can produce state-level prediction as an aggregation of the corresponding county-level predictions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the publicly available benchmark models.	1300
Herd immunity for Covid-19 in homogeneous populations	Janaina P. Zingano,Paulo R. Zingano,Alessandra M. Silva,Carolina P. Zingano	2021/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01808v1	ArXiv	In this note we estimate herd immunity levels for the Covid-19 epidemic using a standard SEIR system that models the disease dynamics in homogeneous populations. The results obtained are indicative of values between 80% and 90% for unprotected, fully susceptible populations. Basic protective measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing may be effective to lower herd immunity levels down to values between 50% and 60% of the total population.	1301
"""Who can help me?"": Knowledge Infused Matching of Support Seekers and  Support Providers during COVID-19 on Reddit"	Manas Gaur,Kaushik Roy,Aditya Sharma,Biplav Srivastava,Amit Sheth	2021/05/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06398v1	ArXiv	During the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, subreddits on Reddit, such as r/Coronavirus saw a rapid growth in user's requests for help (support seekers - SSs) including individuals with varying professions and experiences with diverse perspectives on care (support providers - SPs). Currently, knowledgeable human moderators match an SS with a user with relevant experience, i.e, an SP on these subreddits. This unscalable process defers timely care. We present a medical knowledge-infused approach to efficient matching of SS and SPs validated by experts for the users affected by anxiety and depression, in the context of with COVID-19. After matching, each SP to an SS labeled as either supportive, informative, or similar (sharing experiences) using the principles of natural language inference. Evaluation by 21 domain experts indicates the efficacy of incorporated knowledge and shows the efficacy the matching system.	1302
Brazilian Obstetric Observatory	Agatha Rodrigues,Lucas Lacerda,Rossana Pulcineli Vieira Francisco	2021/05/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06534v2	ArXiv	Covid-19 is responsible for high mortality in all countries, with the maternal population it is no different. Countries with a high rate of maternal mortality have deficiencies in the health care of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth, which will certainly be enhanced in a situation of overload in the health system, as occurred in this pandemic. Understanding the impact of the pandemic on maternal health is essential to discuss public policies and assist in solutions to future crises. With that in mind, we present the Brazilian Obstetric Observatory COVID-19 (OOBr COVID-19).

The challenges and realities of retailing in a COVID-19 world:  Identifying trending and Vital During Crisis keywords during Covid-19 using  Machine Learning (Austria as a case study)	Reda Mastouri Et Al.,Joseph Gilkey	2021/05/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07876v1	ArXiv	From global pandemics to geopolitical turmoil, leaders in logistics, product allocation, procurement and operations are facing increasing difficulty with safeguarding their organizations against supply chain vulnerabilities. It is recommended to opt for forecasting against trending based benchmark because auditing a future forecast puts more focus on seasonality. The forecasting models provide with end-to-end, real time oversight of the entire supply chain, while utilizing predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to identify potential disruptions before they occur. By combining internal and external data points, coming up with an AI-enabled modelling engine can greatly reduce risk by helping retail companies proactively respond to supply and demand variability. This research paper puts focus on creating an ingenious way to tackle the impact of COVID19 on Supply chain, product allocation, trending and seasonality.   Key words: Supply chain, covid-19, forecasting, coronavirus, manufacturing, seasonality, trending, retail.	1304
Randomly Initialized Convolutional Neural Network for the Recognition of  COVID-19 using X-ray Images	Safa Ben Atitallah,Maha Driss,Wadii Boulila,Henda Ben Ghézala	2021/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08199v1	ArXiv	By the start of 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic. Because of the severity of this infectious disease, several kinds of research have focused on combatting its ongoing spread. One potential solution to detect COVID-19 is by analyzing the chest X-ray images using Deep Learning (DL) models. In this context, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are presented as efficient techniques for early diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel randomly initialized CNN architecture for the recognition of COVID-19. This network consists of a set of different-sized hidden layers created from scratch. The performance of this network is evaluated through two public datasets, which are the COVIDx and the enhanced COVID-19 datasets. Both of these datasets consist of 3 different classes of images: COVID19, pneumonia, and normal chest X-ray images. The proposed CNN model yields encouraging results with 94% and 99% of accuracy for COVIDx and enhanced COVID-19 dataset, respectively.	1305
Transfer learning approach to Classify the X-ray image that corresponds  to corona disease Using ResNet50 pretrained by ChexNet	Mahyar Bolhassani	2021/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08382v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus adversely has affected people worldwide. There are common symptoms between the Covid19 virus disease and other respiratory diseases like pneumonia or Influenza. Therefore, diagnosing it fast is crucial not only to save patients but also to prevent it from spreading. One of the most reliant methods of diagnosis is through X-ray images of a lung. With the help of deep learning approaches, we can teach the deep model to learn the condition of an affected lung. Therefore, it can classify the new sample as if it is a Covid19 infected patient or not. In this project, we train a deep model based on ResNet50 pretrained by ImageNet dataset and CheXNet dataset. Based on the imbalanced CoronaHack Chest X-Ray dataset introducing by Kaggle we applied both binary and multi-class classification. Also, we compare the results when using Focal loss and Cross entropy loss.	1306
Climate Action During COVID-19 Recovery and Beyond: A Twitter Text  Mining Study	Mohammad S. Parsa,Lukasz Golab,Srinivasan Keshav	2021/05/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12190v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus pandemic created a global crisis that prompted immediate large-scale action, including economic shutdowns and mobility restrictions. These actions have had devastating effects on the economy, but some positive effects on the environment. As the world recovers from the pandemic, we ask the following question: What is the public attitude towards climate action during COVID-19 recovery and beyond? We answer this question by analyzing discussions on the Twitter social media platform. We find that most discussions support climate action and point out lessons learned during pandemic response that can shape future climate policy, although skeptics continue to have a presence. Additionally, concerns arise in the context of climate action during the pandemic, such as mitigating the risk of COVID-19 transmission on public transit.	1307
Proof-of-Vax: Studying User Preferences and Perception of Covid  Vaccination Certificates	Marvin Kowalewski,Franziska Herbert,Theodor Schnitzler,Markus Dürmuth	2021/06/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11676v1	ArXiv	Digital tools play an important role in fighting the current global COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a representative online study in Germany on a sample of 599 participants to evaluate the user perception of vaccination certificates. We investigated five different variants of vaccination certificates, based on deployed and planned designs in a between-group design, including paper-based and app-based variants. Our main results show that the willingness to use and adopt vaccination certificates is generally high. Overall, paper-based vaccination certificates were favored over app-based solutions. The willingness to use digital apps decreased significantly by a higher disposition to privacy, and increased by higher worries about the pandemic and acceptance of the coronavirus vaccination. Vaccination certificates resemble an interesting use case for studying privacy perceptions for health related data. We hope that our work will be able to educate the currently ongoing design of vaccination certificates, will give us deeper insights into privacy of health-related data and apps, and prepare us for future potential applications of vaccination certificates and health apps in general.	1308
Factors affecting the COVID-19 risk in the US counties: an innovative  approach by combining unsupervised and supervised learning	Samira Ziyadidegan,Moein Razavi,Homa Pesarakli,Amir Hossein Javid,Madhav Erraguntla	2021/06/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12766v2	ArXiv	The COVID-19 disease spreads swiftly, and nearly three months after the first positive case was confirmed in China, Coronavirus started to spread all over the United States. Some states and counties reported high number of positive cases and deaths, while some reported lower COVID-19 related cases and mortality. In this paper, the factors that could affect the risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality were analyzed in county level. An innovative method by using K-means clustering and several classification models is utilized to determine the most critical factors. Results showed that mean temperature, percent of people below poverty, percent of adults with obesity, air pressure, population density, wind speed, longitude, and percent of uninsured people were the most significant attributes	1309
On assessing excess mortality in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic	Giacomo De Nicola,Göran Kauermann,Michael Höhle	2021/06/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13827v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a very high number of casualties in the general population. Assessing the exact magnitude of this number is a non-trivial problem, as relying only on officially reported COVID-19 associated fatalities runs the risk of incurring in several kinds of biases. One of the ways to approach the issue is to compare overall mortality during the pandemic with expected mortality computed using the observed mortality figures of previous years. In this paper, we build on existing methodology and propose two ways to compute expected as well as excess mortality, namely at the weekly and at the yearly level. Particular focus is put on the role of age, which plays a central part in both COVID-19-associated and overall mortality. We illustrate our methods by making use of age-stratified mortality data from the years 2016 to 2020 in Germany to compute age group-specific excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.	1310
Final size and partial distance estimate for the SEIRD model	Alison M. V. D. L. Melo,Matheus C. Santos	2021/06/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14664v2	ArXiv	In this paper we consider a SEIRD epidemic model for a population composed by two groups with asymmetric interaction. Given two sets of parameters for the model, we estimate the distance of the solutions for the second group based on the distance of solutions for the first one. We also study the final size of the epidemic for each group. We illustrate our results with the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the New York County (USA) for the initial stage of the contamination, and in the the cities of Petrolina and Juazeiro (Brazil).	1311
A semiparametric Bayesian approach to epidemics, with application to the  spread of the coronavirus MERS in South Korea in 2015	Michael Schweinberger,Rashmi P. Bomiriya,Sergii Babkin	2021/07/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00375v1	ArXiv	We consider incomplete observations of stochastic processes governing the spread of infectious diseases through finite populations by way of contact. We propose a flexible semiparametric modeling framework with at least three advantages. First, it enables researchers to study the structure of a population contact network and its impact on the spread of infectious diseases. Second, it can accommodate short- and long-tailed degree distributions and detect potential superspreaders, who represent an important public health concern. Third, it addresses the important issue of incomplete data. Starting from first principles, we show when the incomplete-data generating process is ignorable for the purpose of Bayesian inference for the parameters of the population model. We demonstrate the semiparametric modeling framework by simulations and an application to the partially observed MERS epidemic in South Korea in 2015. We conclude with an extended discussion of open questions and directions for future research.	1312
Active elasticity drives the formation of periodic beading in damaged  axons	Davide Riccobelli	2021/07/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01393v1	ArXiv	In several pathological conditions, such as coronavirus infections, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, the physiological shape of axons is altered and a periodic sequence of bulges appears. Experimental evidences suggest that such morphological changes are caused by the disruption of the microtubules composing the cytoskeleton of the axon. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of damaged axons based on the theory of continuum mechanics and nonlinear elasticity. The axon is described as a cylinder composed of an inner passive part, called axoplasm, and an outer active cortex, composed mainly of F-actin and able to contract thanks to myosin-II motors. Through a linear stability analysis we show that, as the shear modulus of the axoplasm diminishes due to the disruption of the cytoskeleton, the active contraction of the cortex makes the cylindrical configuration unstable to axisymmetric perturbations, leading to a beading pattern. Finally, the non-linear evolution of the bifurcated branches is investigated through finite element simulations.	1313
Tackling COVID-19 Infodemic using Deep Learning	Prathmesh Pathwar,Simran Gill	2021/07/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02012v1	ArXiv	Humanity is battling one of the most deleterious virus in modern history, the COVID-19 pandemic, but along with the pandemic there's an infodemic permeating the pupil and society with misinformation which exacerbates the current malady. We try to detect and classify fake news on online media to detect fake information relating to COVID-19 and coronavirus. The dataset contained fake posts, articles and news gathered from fact checking websites like politifact whereas real tweets were taken from verified twitter handles. We incorporated multiple conventional classification techniques like Naive Bayes, KNN, Gradient Boost and Random Forest along with Deep learning approaches, specifically CNN, RNN, DNN and the ensemble model RMDL. We analyzed these approaches with two feature extraction techniques, TF-IDF and GloVe Word Embeddings which would provide deeper insights into the dataset containing COVID-19 info on online media.	1314
Real-Time Face Recognition System for Remote Employee Tracking	Mohammad Sabik Irbaz,MD Abdullah Al Nasim,Refat E Ferdous	2021/07/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07576v2	ArXiv	"During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the human-to-human interactions have been stopped. To mitigate the spread of deadly coronavirus, many offices took the initiative so that the employees can work from home. But, tracking the employees and finding out if they are really performing what they were supposed to turn out to be a serious challenge for all the companies and organizations who are facilitating ""Work From Home"". To deal with the challenge effectively, we came up with a solution to track the employees with face recognition. We have been testing this system experimentally for our office. To train the face recognition module, we used FaceNet with KNN using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset and achieved 97.8\% accuracy. We integrated the trained model into our central system, where the employees log their time. In this paper, we discuss in brief the system we have been experimenting with and the pros and cons of the system."	1315
Evaluating Effectiveness of Public Health Intervention Strategies for  Mitigating COVID-19 Pandemic	Shanghong Xie,Wenbo Wang,Qinxia Wang,Yuanjia Wang,Donglin Zeng	2021/07/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09749v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global public health challenge. In the United States (US), state governments have implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as physical distance closure (lockdown), stay-at-home order, mandatory facial mask in public in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19. To evaluate the effectiveness of these NPIs, we propose a nested case-control design with propensity score weighting under the quasi-experiment framework to estimate the average intervention effect on disease transmission across states. We further develop a method to test for factors that moderate intervention effect to assist precision public health intervention. Our method takes account of the underlying dynamics of disease transmission and balance state-level pre-intervention characteristics. We prove that our estimator provides causal intervention effect under assumptions. We apply this method to analyze US COVID-19 incidence cases to estimate the effects of six interventions. We show that lockdown has the largest effect on reducing transmission and reopening bars significantly increase transmission. States with a higher percentage of non-white population are at greater risk of increased $R_t$ associated with reopening bars.	1316
Medical Literature Mining and Retrieval in a Conversational Setting	Souvik Das,Sougata Saha,Rohini K. Srihari	2021/07/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01436v1	ArXiv	The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a spur in the medical research literature. With new research advances in understanding the virus, there is a need for robust text mining tools which can process, extract and present answers from the literature in a concise and consumable way. With a DialoGPT based multi-turn conversation generation module, and BM-25 \& neural embeddings based ensemble information retrieval module, in this paper we present a conversational system, which can retrieve and answer coronavirus-related queries from the rich medical literature, and present it in a conversational setting with the user. We further perform experiments to compare neural embedding-based document retrieval and the traditional BM25 retrieval algorithm and report the results.	1317
One-step, Wash-free, Nanoparticle Clustering-based Magnetic Particle  Spectroscopy (MPS) Bioassay Method for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and  Nucleocapsid Proteins in Liquid Phase	Kai Wu,Vinit Kumar Chugh,Venkatramana D. Krishna,Arturo di Girolamo,Yongqiang Andrew Wang,Renata Saha,Shuang Liang,Maxim C-J Cheeran,Jian-Ping Wang	2021/08/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01514v1	ArXiv	With the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing quest for more accessible, easy-to-use, rapid, inexpensive, and high accuracy diagnostic tools. Traditional disease diagnostic methods such as qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) require multiple steps, trained technicians, and long turnaround time that may worsen the disease surveillance and pandemic control. In sight of this situation, a rapid, one-step, easy-to-use, and high accuracy diagnostic platform will be valuable for future epidemic control especially for regions with scarce medical resources. Herein, we report a magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers: spike and nucleocapsid proteins.	1318
Masked Face Recognition Challenge: The InsightFace Track Report	Jiankang Deng,Jia Guo,Xiang An,Zheng Zhu,Stefanos Zafeiriou	2021/08/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08191v1	ArXiv	During the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic, almost everyone wears a facial mask, which poses a huge challenge to deep face recognition. In this workshop, we organize Masked Face Recognition (MFR) challenge and focus on bench-marking deep face recognition methods under the existence of facial masks. In the MFR challenge, there are two main tracks: the InsightFace track and the WebFace260M track. For the InsightFace track, we manually collect a large-scale masked face test set with 7K identities. In addition, we also collect a children test set including 14K identities and a multi-racial test set containing 242K identities. By using these three test sets, we build up an online model testing system, which can give a comprehensive evaluation of face recognition models. To avoid data privacy problems, no test image is released to the public. As the challenge is still under-going, we will keep on updating the top-ranked solutions as well as this report on the arxiv.	1319
COVID-19 reproduction number estimated from SEIR model: association with  people's mobility in 2020	Tatiana Petrova,Dmitri Soshnikov,Andrey Grunin	2021/08/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12222v1	ArXiv	This paper is an exploratory study of two epidemiological questions on a worldwide basis. How fast is the disease spreading? Are the restrictions (especially mobility restrictions) for people bring the expected effect? To answer the first question, we propose a tool for estimating the reproduction number of epidemic (the number of secondary infections $R_t$) based on the SEIR model and compare it with an non-model $R_t$ estimation. To measure the $R_t$ of COVID-19 for different countries, real-time data on coronavirus daily cases of infections, recoveries, deaths are retrieved from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. To assess the effectiveness of mobility restrictions for the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the correlations between the $R_t$ and people's mobility (based on the Apple mobility index) are presented. The correlations were considered for 12 countries and for most of them, the correlations are negative. This shows a delay in the implementation of mobility restrictions - the countries imposed them in response to growth of new COVID-19 cases, rather than preventively.	1320
Variance of Twitter Embeddings and Temporal Trends of COVID-19 cases	Mayank Sethi,Ambika Sadhu,Khushbu Pahwa,Sargun Nagpal,Tavpritesh Sethi	2021/09/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00031v2	ArXiv	The severity of the coronavirus pandemic necessitates the need of effective administrative decisions. Over 4 lakh people in India succumbed to COVID-19, with over 3 crore confirmed cases, and still counting. The threat of a plausible third wave continues to haunt millions. In this ever changing dynamic of the virus, predictive modeling methods can serve as an integral tool. The pandemic has further triggered an unprecedented usage of social media. This paper aims to propose a method for harnessing social media, specifically Twitter, to predict the upcoming scenarios related to COVID-19 cases. In this study, we seek to understand how the surges in COVID-19 related tweets can indicate rise in the cases. This prospective analysis can be utilised to aid administrators about timely resource allocation to lessen the severity of the damage. Using word embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of tweets, we identify Significant Dimensions (SDs).Our methodology predicts the rise in cases with a lead time of 15 days and 30 days with R2 scores of 0.80 and 0.62 respectively. Finally, we explain the thematic utility of the SDs.	1321
Predicting COVID-19 Patient Shielding: A Comprehensive Study	Vithya Yogarajan,Jacob Montiel,Tony Smith,Bernhard Pfahringer	2021/10/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00183v1	ArXiv	There are many ways machine learning and big data analytics are used in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, including predictions, risk management, diagnostics, and prevention. This study focuses on predicting COVID-19 patient shielding -- identifying and protecting patients who are clinically extremely vulnerable from coronavirus. This study focuses on techniques used for the multi-label classification of medical text. Using the information published by the United Kingdom NHS and the World Health Organisation, we present a novel approach to predicting COVID-19 patient shielding as a multi-label classification problem. We use publicly available, de-identified ICU medical text data for our experiments. The labels are derived from the published COVID-19 patient shielding data. We present an extensive comparison across 12 multi-label classifiers from the simple binary relevance to neural networks and the most recent transformers. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study, where such a range of multi-label classifiers for medical text are considered. We highlight the benefits of various approaches, and argue that, for the task at hand, both predictive accuracy and processing time are essential.	1322
How mass surveillance can crowd out installations of COVID-19 contact  tracing apps	Eran Toch,Oshrat Ayalon	2021/10/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01567v1	ArXiv	During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have developed and deployed contact tracing technologies to curb the spread of the disease by locating and isolating people who have been in contact with coronavirus carriers. Subsequently, understanding why people install and use contact tracing apps is becoming central to their effectiveness and impact. This paper analyzes situations where centralized mass surveillance technologies are deployed simultaneously with a voluntary contact tracing mobile app. We use this parallel deployment as a natural experiment that tests how attitudes toward mass deployments affect people's installation of the contact tracing app. Based on a representative survey of Israelis (n=519), our findings show that positive attitudes toward mass surveillance were related to a reduced likelihood of installing contact tracing apps and an increased likelihood of uninstalling them. These results also hold when controlling for privacy concerns about the contact tracing app, attitudes toward the app, trust in authorities, and demographic properties. Similar reasoning may also be relevant for crowding out voluntary participation in data collection systems.	1323
AraCOVID19-SSD: Arabic COVID-19 Sentiment and Sarcasm Detection Dataset	Mohamed Seghir Hadj Ameur,Hassina Aliane	2021/10/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01948v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that was first discovered in late December 2019, in Wuhan, China, and then spread worldwide causing a lot of panic and death. Users of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have been focused on reading, publishing, and sharing novelties, tweets, and articles regarding the newly emerging pandemic. A lot of these users often employ sarcasm to convey their intended meaning in a humorous, funny, and indirect way making it hard for computer-based applications to automatically understand and identify their goal and the harm level that they can inflect. Motivated by the emerging need for annotated datasets that tackle these kinds of problems in the context of COVID-19, this paper builds and releases AraCOVID19-SSD a manually annotated Arabic COVID-19 sarcasm and sentiment detection dataset containing 5,162 tweets. To confirm the practical utility of the built dataset, it has been carefully analyzed and tested using several classification models.	1324
New insights into price drivers of crude oil futures markets: Evidence  from quantile ARDL approach	Hao-Lin Shao,Ying-Hui Shao,Yan-Hong Yang	2021/10/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02693v1	ArXiv	This paper investigates the cointegration between possible determinants of crude oil futures prices during the COVID-19 pandemic period. We perform comparative analysis of WTI and newly-launched Shanghai crude oil futures (SC) via the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) model. The empirical results confirm that economic policy uncertainty, stock markets, interest rates and coronavirus panic are important drivers of WTI futures prices. Our findings also suggest that the US and China's stock markets play vital roles in movements of SC futures prices. Meanwhile, CSI300 stock index has a significant positive short-run impact on SC futures prices while S\&P500 prices possess a positive nexus with SC futures prices both in long-run and short-run. Overall, these empirical evidences provide practical implications for investors and policymakers.	1325
COVID-Datathon: Biomarker identification for COVID-19 severity based on  BALF scRNA-seq data	Seyednami Niyakan,Xiaoning Qian	2021/10/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04986v1	ArXiv	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emergence began in late 2019 and has since spread rapidly worldwide. The characteristics of respiratory immune response to this emerging virus is not clear. Recently, Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) transcriptome profiling of Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells has been done to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying in COVID-19. With the aim of better utilizing this atlas of BALF cells in response to the virus, here we propose a bioinformatics pipeline to identify candidate biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, which may help characterize BALF cells to have better mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proposed pipeline is implemented in R and is available at https://github.com/namini94/scBALF_Hackathon.	1326
Predicting the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi, India using Deep Residual  Recurrent Neural Networks	Shashank Reddy Vadyala,Sai Nethra Betgeri	2021/10/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05477v1	ArXiv	Detecting the spread of coronavirus will go a long way toward reducing human and economic loss. Unfortunately, existing Epidemiological models used for COVID 19 prediction models are too slow and fail to capture the COVID-19 development in detail. This research uses Partial Differential Equations to improve the processing speed and accuracy of forecasting of COVID 19 governed by SEIRD model equations. The dynamics of COVID 19 were extracted using Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Residual Recurrent Neural Networks from data simulated using PDEs. The DRRNNs accuracy is measured using Mean Squared Error. The DRRNNs COVID-19 prediction model has been shown to have accurate COVID-19 predictions. In addition, we concluded that DR-RNNs can significantly advance the ability to support decision-making in real time COVID-19 prediction.	1327
Improving overlay maps of science: combining overview and detail	Peter Sjögårde	2021/10/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07917v2	ArXiv	Overlay maps of science are global base maps over which subsets of publications can be projected. Such maps can be used to monitor, explore, and study research through its publication output. Most maps of science, including overlay maps, are flat in the sense that they visualize research fields at one single level. Such maps generally fail to provide both overview and detail about the research being analyzed. The aim of this study is to improve overlay maps of science to provide both features in a single visualization. I created a map based on a hierarchical classification of publications, including broad disciplines for overview and more granular levels to incorporate detailed information. The classification was obtained by clustering articles in a citation network of about 17 million publication records in PubMed from 1995 onwards. The map emphasizes the hierarchical structure of the classification by visualizing both disciplines and the underlying specialties. To show how the visualization methodology can help getting both overview of research and detailed information about its topical structure, I projected two overlay maps onto the base map: (1) open access publishing and (2) coronavirus/Covid-19 research.	1328
Automatic Detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray using  Deep Learning	Sarath Pathari	2021/10/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09384v1	ArXiv	In this study, a dataset of X-ray images from patients with common viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, confirmed Covid-19 disease was utilized for the automatic detection of the Coronavirus disease. The point of the investigation is to assess the exhibition of cutting edge convolutional neural system structures proposed over the ongoing years for clinical picture order. In particular, the system called Transfer Learning was received. With transfer learning, the location of different variations from the norm in little clinical picture datasets is a reachable objective, regularly yielding amazing outcomes. The datasets used in this trial. Firstly, a collection of 24000 X-ray images includes 6000 images for confirmed Covid-19 disease,6000 confirmed common bacterial pneumonia and 6000 images of normal conditions. The information was gathered and expanded from the accessible X-Ray pictures on open clinical stores. The outcomes recommend that Deep Learning with X-Ray imaging may separate noteworthy biological markers identified with the Covid-19 sickness, while the best precision, affectability, and particularity acquired is 97.83%, 96.81%, and 98.56% individually.	1329
Early Diagnostic Prediction of Covid-19 using Gradient-Boosting Machine  Model	Satvik Tripathi	2021/10/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09436v2	ArXiv	With the huge spike in the COVID-19 cases across the globe and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test remains a key component for rapid and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In recent months there has been an acute shortage of medical supplies in developing countries, especially a lack of RT-PCR testing resulting in delayed patient care and high infection rates. We present a gradient-boosting machine model that predicts the diagnostics result of SARS-CoV- 2 in an RT-PCR test by utilizing eight binary features. We used the publicly available nationwide dataset released by the Israeli Ministry of Health.	1330
A Markov Chain Model for COVID19 in Mexico City	Carlos Martinez-Rodriguez	2021/10/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13816v2	ArXiv	This paper presents a model for COVID19 in Mexico City. The data analyzed were considered from the appearance of the first case in Mexico until July 2021. In this first approximation the states considered were Susceptible, Infected, Hospitalized, Intensive Care Unit, Intubated, and Dead. As a consequence of the lack of coronavirus testing, the number of infected and dead people is underestimated, although the results obtained give a good approximation to the evolution of the pandemic in Mexico City. The model is based on a discrete-time Markov chain considering data provided by the Mexican government, the main objective is to estimate the transient probabilities from one state to another for the Mexico City case.	1331
Modelling of spatial infection spread through heterogeneous population:  from lattice to PDE models	A. Vaziry,T. Kolokolnikov,P. G. Kevrekidis	2021/10/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13956v1	ArXiv	We present a simple model for the spread of an infection that incorporates spatial variability in population density. Starting from first principle considerations, we explore how a novel PDE with state-dependent diffusion can be obtained. This model exhibits higher infection rates in the areas of higher population density, a feature that we argue to be consistent with epidemiological observations. The model also exhibits an infection wave whose speed varies with population density. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility that an infection can ``jump'' (i.e., tunnel) across areas of low population density towards the areas of high population density. We briefly touch upon the data reported for coronavirus spread in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia as a case example with a number of qualitatively similar features as our model. Lastly, we propose a number of generalizations of the model towards future studies.	1332
Natural Language Processing for Smart Healthcare	Binggui Zhou,Guanghua Yang,Zheng Shi,Shaodan Ma	2021/10/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15803v3	ArXiv	Smart healthcare has achieved significant progress in recent years. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies enable various smart applications across various healthcare scenarios. As an essential technology powered by AI, natural language processing (NLP) plays a key role in smart healthcare due to its capability of analysing and understanding human language. In this work, we review existing studies that concern NLP for smart healthcare from the perspectives of technique and application. We first elaborate on different NLP approaches and the NLP pipeline for smart healthcare from the technical point of view. Then, in the context of smart healthcare applications employing NLP techniques, we introduce representative smart healthcare scenarios, including clinical practice, hospital management, personal care, public health, and drug development. We further discuss two specific medical issues, i.e., the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mental health, in which NLP-driven smart healthcare plays an important role. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current works and identify the directions for future works.	1333
A Discrete-Time Compartmental Epidemiological Model for COVID-19 with a  Case Study for Portugal	Sandra Vaz,Delfim F. M. Torres	2021/11/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11860v1	ArXiv	In [Ecological Complexity 44 (2020) Art. 100885, DOI: 10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100885] a continuous-time compartmental mathematical model for the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is presented with Portugal as case study, from 2 March to 4 May 2020, and the local stability of the Disease Free Equilibrium (DFE) is analysed. Here, we propose an analogous discrete-time model and, using a suitable Lyapunov function, we prove the global stability of the DFE point. Using COVID-19 real data, we show, through numerical simulations, the consistence of the obtained theoretical results.	1334
The relationship between sentiment score and COVID-19 cases in the  United States	Truong Luu,Rosangela Follmann	2022/01/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01708v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to have devastating effects across the globe. No nation has been free from the uncertainty brought by this pandemic. The health, social and economic tolls associated with it are causing strong emotions and spreading fear in people of all ages, genders, and races. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have expressed their feelings and opinions related to a wide range of aspects of their lives via Twitter. In this study, we consider a framework for extracting sentiment scores and opinions from COVID-19 related tweets. We connect users' sentiment with COVID-19 cases across the USA and investigate the effect of specific COVID-19 milestones on public sentiment. The results of this work may help with the development of pandemic-related legislation, serve as a guide for scientific work, as well as inform and educate the public on core issues related to the pandemic.	1335
Understanding Twitters behavior during the pandemic: Fake News and Fear	Guillermo Romera Rodriguez,Sanjana Gautam,Andrea Tapia	2022/02/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05134v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been accompanied by a large amount of misleading and false information about the virus, especially on social media. During the pandemic social media gained special interest as it went on to become an important medium of communication. This made the information being relayed on these platforms especially critical. In our work, we aim to explore the percentage of fake news being spread on Twitter as well as measure the sentiment of the public at the same time. We further study how the sentiment of fear is present among the public. In addition to that we compare the rate of spread of the virus per day with the rate of spread of fake news on Twitter. Our study is useful in establishing the role of Twitter, and social media, during a crisis, and more specifically during crisis management.	1336
The potential of artificial intelligence for achieving healthy and  sustainable societies	B. Sirmacek,S. Gupta,F. Mallor,H. Azizpour,Y. Ban,H. Eivazi,H. Fang,F. Golzar,I. Leite,G. I. Melsion,K. Smith,F. Fuso Nerini,R. Vinuesa	2022/02/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07424v1	ArXiv	In this chapter we extend earlier work (Vinuesa et al., Nature Communications 11, 2020) on the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations (UN) for the 2030 Agenda. The present contribution focuses on three SDGs related to healthy and sustainable societies, i.e. SDG 3 (on good health), SDG 11 (on sustainable cities) and SDG 13 (on climate action). This chapter extends the previous study within those three goals, and goes beyond the 2030 targets. These SDGs are selected because they are closely related to the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, and also to crises like climate change, which constitute important challenges to our society.	1337
Artificial Intelligence-Based Analytics for Impacts of COVID-19 and  Online Learning on College Students' Mental Health	Mostafa Rezapour,Scott K. Elmshaeuser	2022/02/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07441v3	ArXiv	COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first emerged in Wuhan, China late in December 2019. Not long after, the virus spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This caused many changes around the world and in the United States, including an educational shift towards online learning. In this paper, we seek to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic and increase in online learning impact college students' emotional wellbeing. We use several machine learning and statistical models to analyze data collected by the Faculty of Public Administration at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia in conjunction with an international consortium of universities, other higher education institutions, and students' associations. Our results indicate that features related to students' academic life have the largest impact on their emotional wellbeing. Other important factors include students' satisfaction with their university's and government's handling of the pandemic as well as students' financial security.	1338
OSegNet: Operational Segmentation Network for COVID-19 Detection using  Chest X-ray Images	Aysen Degerli,Serkan Kiranyaz,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Moncef Gabbouj	2022/02/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10185v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been diagnosed automatically using Machine Learning algorithms over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, most of the earlier studies used Deep Learning models over scarce datasets bearing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, previous studies have revealed the fact that deep networks are not reliable for classification since their decisions may originate from irrelevant areas on the CXRs. Therefore, in this study, we propose Operational Segmentation Network (OSegNet) that performs detection by segmenting COVID-19 pneumonia for a reliable diagnosis. To address the data scarcity encountered in training and especially in evaluation, this study extends the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 121,378 CXRs including 9258 COVID-19 samples with their corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks that are publicly shared with the research community. Consequently, OSegNet has achieved a detection performance with the highest accuracy of 99.65% among the state-of-the-art deep models with 98.09% precision.	1339
A new LDA formulation with covariates	Gilson Shimizu,Rafael Izbicki,Denis Valle	2022/02/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11527v1	ArXiv	The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is a popular method for creating mixed-membership clusters. Despite having been originally developed for text analysis, LDA has been used for a wide range of other applications. We propose a new formulation for the LDA model which incorporates covariates. In this model, a negative binomial regression is embedded within LDA, enabling straight-forward interpretation of the regression coefficients and the analysis of the quantity of cluster-specific elements in each sampling units (instead of the analysis being focused on modeling the proportion of each cluster, as in Structural Topic Models). We use slice sampling within a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate model parameters. We rely on simulations to show how our algorithm is able to successfully retrieve the true parameter values and the ability to make predictions for the abundance matrix using the information given by the covariates. The model is illustrated using real data sets from three different areas: text-mining of Coronavirus articles, analysis of grocery shopping baskets, and ecology of tree species on Barro Colorado Island (Panama). This model allows the identification of mixed-membership clusters in discrete data and provides inference on the relationship between covariates and the abundance of these clusters.	1340
Evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and optimal strategies  for containing the COVID-19 pandemic	Xiao Zhou,Xiaohu Zhang,Paolo Santi,Carlo Ratti	2022/02/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13980v1	ArXiv	Given multiple new COVID-19 variants are continuously emerging, non-pharmaceutical interventions are still primary control strategies to curb the further spread of coronavirus. However, implementing strict interventions over extended periods of time is inevitably hurting the economy. With an aim to solve this multi-objective decision-making problem, we investigate the underlying associations between policies, mobility patterns, and virus transmission. We further evaluate the relative performance of existing COVID-19 control measures and explore potential optimal strategies that can strike the right balance between public health and socio-economic recovery for individual states in the US. The results highlight the power of state of emergency declaration and wearing face masks and emphasize the necessity of pursuing tailor-made strategies for different states and phases of epidemiological transmission. Our framework enables policymakers to create more refined designs of COVID-19 strategies and can be extended to inform policy makers of any country about best practices in pandemic response.	1341
POSTER: Diagnosis of COVID-19 through Transfer Learning Techniques on CT  Scans: A Comparison of Deep Learning Models	Aeyan Ashraf,Asad Malik,Zahid Khan	2022/03/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09348v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) constitutes a public health emergency globally. It is a deadly disease which has infected more than 230 million people worldwide. Therefore, early and unswerving detection of COVID-19 is necessary. Evidence of this virus is most commonly being tested by RT-PCR test. This test is not 100% reliable as it is known to give false positives and false negatives. Other methods like X-Ray images or CT scans show the detailed imaging of lungs and have been proven more reliable. This paper compares different deep learning models used to detect COVID-19 through transfer learning technique on CT scan dataset. VGG-16 outperforms all the other models achieving an accuracy of 85.33% on the dataset.	1342
Diagnosis of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-ray Images Using Deep Neural  Network and LightGBM	Mobina Ezzoddin,Hamid Nasiri,Morteza Dorrigiv	2022/03/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14275v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and then led to a pandemic with a rapid worldwide outbreak. The number of infected people has been swiftly increasing since then. Therefore, in this study, an attempt was made to propose a new and efficient method for automatic diagnosis of Corona disease from X-ray images using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In the proposed method, the DensNet169 was used to extract the features of the patients' Chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The extracted features were given to a feature selection algorithm (i.e., ANOVA) to select a number of them. Finally, the selected features were classified by LightGBM algorithm. The proposed approach was evaluated on the ChestX-ray8 dataset and reached 99.20% and 94.22% accuracies in the two-class (i.e., COVID-19 and No-findings) and multi-class (i.e., COVID-19, Pneumonia, and No-findings) classification problems, respectively.	1343
Social distancing between particles and objects in the Universe	Door van Flonkelaar,Bozef Jucko,Gudit Marg,Koah Nubli,Schebastian Sulz	2022/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16982v1	ArXiv	"The novel coronavirus, dubbed COVID-19, upended our lives may be in irreversible ways during its initial spread throughout the world in March 2020. It forced us all, willingly or unwillingly, to keep social distance from each other to slow down the spread of COVID-19. As scientists, we started speculating what kind of separation is between the constitutes of different objects in the Universe. In this work, we study the ""social"" distance between elements inside various objects, no matter their size, mass, and nature. We consider things ranging from diamond, baseball to Saturn, asteroid belt or M87 Black Hole, to name a few. We show our results in the form of a fascinating mass/""social"" distance plot, where a cool cartoon figure represents each object."	1344
CCAT-NET: A Novel Transformer Based Semi-supervised Framework for  Covid-19 Lung Lesion Segmentation	Mingyang Liu,Li Xiao,Huiqin Jiang,Qing He	2022/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02839v1	ArXiv	The spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed millions of lives. Automatic segmentation of lesions from CT images can assist doctors with screening, treatment, and monitoring. However, accurate segmentation of lesions from CT images can be very challenging due to data and model limitations. Recently, Transformer-based networks have attracted a lot of attention in the area of computer vision, as Transformer outperforms CNN at a bunch of tasks. In this work, we propose a novel network structure that combines CNN and Transformer for the segmentation of COVID-19 lesions. We further propose an efficient semi-supervised learning framework to address the shortage of labeled data. Extensive experiments showed that our proposed network outperforms most existing networks and the semi-supervised learning framework can outperform the base network by 3.0% and 8.2% in terms of Dice coefficient and sensitivity.	1345
Coronavirus RNA Sensor Using Single-Stranded DNA Bonded to  Sub-Percolated Gold Films on Monolayer Graphene Field-Effect Transistors	Nicholas E. Fuhr,Mohamed Azize,David J. Bishop	2022/05/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05143v1	ArXiv	Electrical detection of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a promising approach to enhancing transcriptomics and disease diagnostics because of its sensitivity, rapidity, and modularity. Reported here is a fast SARS-CoV-2 mRNA biosensor (<1 minute) with a limit of detection of 1 aM, and dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude and a linear sensitivity of 22 mV per molar decade. These figures of merit were obtained on photoresistlessly patterned monolayer graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) derived from commercial four-inch graphene on 90 nm of silicon dioxide on p-type silicon. Then, to facilitate mRNA hybridization, graphene sensing mesa were coated with an ultrathin sub-percolation threshold gold film for bonding 3'-thiolated single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) probes complementary to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene. Sub-percolated gold was used to minimize the distance between the graphene material and surface hybridization events. The liquid-transfer characteristics of the graphene FETs repeatedly shows correlation between the Dirac voltage and the copy number of polynucleotide. Ultrathin percolated gold films on graphene FETs facilitate two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) mRNA biosensors for transcriptomic profiling.	1346
A novel analysis approach of uniform persistence for a COVID-19 model  with quarantine and standard incidence rate	Songbai Guo,Yuling Xue,Xiliang Li,Zuohuan Zheng	2022/05/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15560v2	ArXiv	A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) model with quarantine and standard incidence rate is first developed, then a novel analysis approach for finding the ultimate lower bound of COVID-19 infectious individuals is proposed, which means that the COVID-19 pandemic is uniformly persistent if the control reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_{c}>1$. This approach can be applied to other related biomathematical models, and some existing works can be improved by using it. In addition, the COVID-19-free equilibrium $V^0$ is locally asymptotically stable (LAS) if $\mathcal{R}_{c}<1$ and linearly stable if $\mathcal{R}_{c}=1$, respectively; while $V^0$ is unstable if $\mathcal{R}_{c}>1$.	1347
Self-Knowledge Distillation based Self-Supervised Learning for Covid-19  Detection from Chest X-Ray Images	Guang Li,Ren Togo,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama	2022/06/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03009v1	ArXiv	The global outbreak of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has overloaded worldwide healthcare systems. Computer-aided diagnosis for COVID-19 fast detection and patient triage is becoming critical. This paper proposes a novel self-knowledge distillation based self-supervised learning method for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images. Our method can use self-knowledge of images based on similarities of their visual features for self-supervised learning. Experimental results show that our method achieved an HM score of 0.988, an AUC of 0.999, and an accuracy of 0.957 on the largest open COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset.	1348
A COVID-19 Search Engine (CO-SE) with Transformer-based Architecture	Shaina Raza	2022/06/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03474v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to the growing literature on COVID-19, it is hard to get precise, up-to-date information about the virus. Practitioners, front-line workers, and researchers require expert-specific methods to stay current on scientific knowledge and research findings. However, there are a lot of research papers being written on the subject, which makes it hard to keep up with the most recent research. This problem motivates us to propose the design of the COVID-19 Search Engine (CO-SE), which is an algorithmic system that finds relevant documents for each query (asked by a user) and answers complex questions by searching a large corpus of publications. The CO-SE has a retriever component trained on the TF-IDF vectorizer that retrieves the relevant documents from the system. It also consists of a reader component that consists of a Transformer-based model, which is used to read the paragraphs and find the answers related to the query from the retrieved documents. The proposed model has outperformed previous models, obtaining an exact match ratio score of 71.45% and a semantic answer similarity score of 78.55%. It also outperforms other benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed approach.	1349
COVID-19 Detection using Transfer Learning with Convolutional Neural  Network	Pramit Dutta,Tanny Roy,Nafisa Anjum	2022/06/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08557v1	ArXiv	The Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal infectious disease, first recognized in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has gone on an epidemic situation. Under these circumstances, it became more important to detect COVID-19 in infected people. Nowadays, the testing kits are gradually lessening in number compared to the number of infected population. Under recent prevailing conditions, the diagnosis of lung disease by analyzing chest CT (Computed Tomography) images has become an important tool for both diagnosis and prophecy of COVID-19 patients. In this study, a Transfer learning strategy (CNN) for detecting COVID-19 infection from CT images has been proposed. In the proposed model, a multilayer Convolutional neural network (CNN) with Transfer learning model Inception V3 has been designed. Similar to CNN, it uses convolution and pooling to extract features, but this transfer learning model contains weights of dataset Imagenet. Thus it can detect features very effectively which gives it an upper hand for achieving better accuracy.	1350
Quadratic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic: merging hotspots and  reinfections	Axel Brandenburg	2022/06/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15459v2	ArXiv	The existence of an exponential growth phase during early stages of a pandemic is often taken for granted. However, for the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic, the early exponential phase lasted only for about six days, while the quadratic growth prevailed for forty days until it spread to other countries and continued, again quadratically, but with a larger coefficient. Here we show that this rapid phase is followed by a subsequent slow-down where the coefficient is reduced to almost the original value at the outbreak. This can be explained by the merging of previously disconnected sites that occurred after the disease jumped (nonlocally) to a relatively small number of separated sites. Subsequent variations in the slope with continued growth can qualitatively be explained as a result of reinfections and changes in their rate. We demonstrate that the observed behavior can be described by a standard epidemiological model with spatial extent and reinfections included. Time-dependent changes in the spatial diffusion coefficient can also model corresponding variations in the slope.	1351
COVID-19 Disease Identification on Chest-CT images using CNN and VGG16	Briskline Kiruba S,Petchiammal A,D. Murugan	2022/07/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04212v1	ArXiv	A newly identified coronavirus disease called COVID-19 mainly affects the human respiratory system. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Early diagnosis is the primary challenge of health care providers. In the earlier stage, medical organizations were dazzled because there were no proper health aids or medicine to detect a COVID-19. A new diagnostic tool RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction), was introduced. It collects swab specimens from the patient's nose or throat, where the COVID-19 virus gathers. This method has some limitations related to accuracy and testing time. Medical experts suggest an alternative approach called CT (Computed Tomography) that can quickly diagnose the infected lung areas and identify the COVID-19 in an earlier stage. Using chest CT images, computer researchers developed several deep learning models identifying the COVID-19 disease. This study presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and VGG16-based model for automated COVID-19 identification on chest CT images. The experimental results using a public dataset of 14320 CT images showed a classification accuracy of 96.34% and 96.99% for CNN and VGG16, respectively.	1352
Mechanics of diffusion-mediated budding and implications for virus  replication and infection	Mattia Bacca	2022/07/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10907v3	ArXiv	Budding allows virus replication and macromolecular secretion in cells. It involves the formation of a bud, i.e. an outgrowth from the cell membrane that evolves into an envelope. The largest energetic barrier to bud formation is membrane deflection and is trespassed primarily thanks to nucleocapsid-membrane adhesion. Transmembrane proteins (TPs), which later form the virus ligands, are the main promotors of adhesion and can accommodate membrane bending thanks to an induced spontaneous curvature. Adhesive TPs must diffuse across the membrane from remote regions to gather on the bud surface, thus, diffusivity controls the kinetics. This paper proposes a simple model to describe diffusion-mediated budding unraveling important size limitations and size-dependent kinetics. The predicted optimal virion radius, giving the fastest budding, is validated against experiments for Coronavirus, HIV, Flu, and Hepatitis. Assuming exponential replication of virions and hereditary size, the model can predict the size distribution of a virus population. This is verified against experiments for SARS-CoV-2. All the above comparisons rely on the premise that budding poses the tightest size constraint. This is true in most cases, as demonstrated in this paper, where the proposed model is extended to describe virus infection via receptor- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and via membrane fusion.	1353
Deep COVID-19 Recognition using Chest X-ray Images: A Comparative  Analysis	Selvarajah Thuseethan,Chathrie Wimalasooriya,Shanmuganathan Vasanthapriyan	2022/07/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00784v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus variant, which is also widely known as COVID-19, is currently a common threat to all humans across the world. Effective recognition of COVID-19 using advanced machine learning methods is a timely need. Although many sophisticated approaches have been proposed in the recent past, they still struggle to achieve expected performances in recognizing COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. In addition, the majority of them are involved with the complex pre-processing task, which is often challenging and time-consuming. Meanwhile, deep networks are end-to-end and have shown promising results in image-based recognition tasks during the last decade. Hence, in this work, some widely used state-of-the-art deep networks are evaluated for COVID-19 recognition with chest X-ray images. All the deep networks are evaluated on a publicly available chest X-ray image dataset. The evaluation results show that the deep networks can effectively recognize COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Further, the comparison results reveal that the EfficientNetB7 network outperformed other existing state-of-the-art techniques.	1354
Comprehensively identifying Long Covid articles with human-in-the-loop  machine learning	Robert Leaman,Rezarta Islamaj,Alexis Allot,Qingyu Chen,W. John Wilbur,Zhiyong Lu	2022/09/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08124v2	ArXiv	A significant percentage of COVID-19 survivors experience ongoing multisystemic symptoms that often affect daily living, a condition known as Long Covid or post-acute-sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, identifying scientific articles relevant to Long Covid is challenging since there is no standardized or consensus terminology. We developed an iterative human-in-the-loop machine learning framework combining data programming with active learning into a robust ensemble model, demonstrating higher specificity and considerably higher sensitivity than other methods. Analysis of the Long Covid collection shows that (1) most Long Covid articles do not refer to Long Covid by any name (2) when the condition is named, the name used most frequently in the literature is Long Covid, and (3) Long Covid is associated with disorders in a wide variety of body systems. The Long Covid collection is updated weekly and is searchable online at the LitCovid portal: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/docsum?filters=e_condition.LongCovid	1355
A Tent Lévy Flying Sparrow Search Algorithm for Feature Selection: A  COVID-19 Case Study	Qinwen Yang,Yuelin Gao,Yanjie Song	2022/09/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10542v1	ArXiv	"The ""Curse of Dimensionality"" induced by the rapid development of information science, might have a negative impact when dealing with big datasets. In this paper, we propose a variant of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), called Tent L\'evy flying sparrow search algorithm (TFSSA), and use it to select the best subset of features in the packing pattern for classification purposes. SSA is a recently proposed algorithm that has not been systematically applied to feature selection problems. After verification by the CEC2020 benchmark function, TFSSA is used to select the best feature combination to maximize classification accuracy and minimize the number of selected features. The proposed TFSSA is compared with nine algorithms in the literature. Nine evaluation metrics are used to properly evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms on twenty-one datasets from the UCI repository. Furthermore, the approach is applied to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dataset, yielding the best average classification accuracy and the average number of feature selections, respectively, of 93.47% and 2.1. Experimental results confirm the advantages of the proposed algorithm in improving classification accuracy and reducing the number of selected features compared to other wrapper-based algorithms."	1356
This is what a pandemic looks like: Visual framing of COVID-19 on search  engines	Mykola Makhortykh,Aleksandra Urman,Roberto Ulloa	2022/09/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11120v1	ArXiv	"In today's high-choice media environment, search engines play an integral role in informing individuals and societies about the latest events. The importance of search algorithms is even higher at the time of crisis, when users search for information to understand the causes and the consequences of the current situation and decide on their course of action. In our paper, we conduct a comparative audit of how different search engines prioritize visual information related to COVID-19 and what consequences it has for the representation of the pandemic. Using a virtual agent-based audit approach, we examine image search results for the term ""coronavirus"" in English, Russian and Chinese on five major search engines: Google, Yandex, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo. Specifically, we focus on how image search results relate to generic news frames (e.g., the attribution of responsibility, human interest, and economics) used in relation to COVID-19 and how their visual composition varies between the search engines."	1357
Ongoing effects of pandemic-imposed learning disruption on student  attitudes	Teemu Hynninen,Henna Pesonen,Olli Lintu,Petriina Paturi	2022/09/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13977v1	ArXiv	We present a study on the development of Finnish first-year physics majors' attitudes towards physics, as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey, before, during and after the period of mandatory remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic. We find that in the years before the pandemic, these attitudes did not change, but the period of extended remote learning due to the pandemic had a negative effect on the students' expert-like views. Similarly, the students who experienced the remote learning period in high school displayed a lower level of expert-like thinking as they entered university. As contact teaching resumed, moderate positive gains were seen, bridging some but not all of the gap in student attitudes left by the pandemic.	1358
Novelty in news search: a longitudinal study of the 2020 US elections	Roberto Ulloa,Mykola Makhortykh,Aleksandra Urman,Juhi Kulshrestha	2022/11/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04746v1	ArXiv	"The 2020 US elections news coverage was extensive, with new pieces of information generated rapidly. This evolving scenario presented an opportunity to study the performance of search engines in a context in which they had to quickly process information as it was published. We analyze novelty, a measurement of new items that emerge in the top news search results, to compare the coverage and visibility of different topics. We conduct a longitudinal study of news results of five search engines collected in short-bursts (every 21 minutes) from two regions (Oregon, US and Frankfurt, Germany), starting on election day and lasting until one day after the announcement of Biden as the winner. We find more new items emerging for election related queries (""joe biden"", ""donald trump"" and ""us elections"") compared to topical (e.g., ""coronavirus"") or stable (e.g., ""holocaust"") queries. We demonstrate differences across search engines and regions over time, and we highlight imbalances between candidate queries. When it comes to news search, search engines are responsible for such imbalances, either due to their algorithms or the set of news sources they rely on. We argue that such imbalances affect the visibility of political candidates in news searches during electoral periods."	1359
Clustering of countries based on the associated social contact patterns  in epidemiological modelling	Evans Kiptoo Korir,Zsolt Vizi	2022/11/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06426v1	ArXiv	"Mathematical models have been used to understand the spread patterns of infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The transmission component of the models can be modelled in an age-dependent manner via introducing contact matrix for the population, which describes the contact rates between the age groups. Since social contact patterns vary from country to country, we can compare and group the countries using the corresponding contact matrices. In this paper, we present a framework for clustering countries based on their contact matrices with respect to an underlying epidemic model. Since the pipeline is generic and modular, we demonstrate its application in a COVID-19 model from R\""ost et. al. which gives a hint about which countries can be compared in a pandemic situation, when only non-pharmaceutical interventions are available."	1360
From Fake News to #FakeNews: Mining Direct and Indirect Relationships  among Hashtags for Fake News Detection	Xinyi Zhou,Reza Zafarani,Emilio Ferrara	2022/11/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11113v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic has gained worldwide attention and allowed fake news, such as ``COVID-19 is the flu,'' to spread quickly and widely on social media. Combating this coronavirus infodemic demands effective methods to detect fake news. To this end, we propose a method to infer news credibility from hashtags involved in news dissemination on social media, motivated by the tight connection between hashtags and news credibility observed in our empirical analyses. We first introduce a new graph that captures all (direct and \textit{indirect}) relationships among hashtags. Then, a language-independent semi-supervised algorithm is developed to predict fake news based on this constructed graph. This study first investigates the indirect relationship among hashtags; the proposed approach can be extended to any homogeneous graph to capture a comprehensive relationship among nodes. Language independence opens the proposed method to multilingual fake news detection. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying fake news, especially at an \textit{early} stage of propagation.	1361
Distance Teaching Experience of Campus-based Teachers at Times of  Pandemic Confinement	Abbas Cheddad,Christian Nordahl	2022/11/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16280v1	ArXiv	Amidst the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic, distance education, where the learning process is conducted online, has become the norm. Campus-based programs and courses have been redesigned in a timely manner which was a challenge for teachers not used to distance teaching. Students engagement and active participation become an issue; add to that new emerging effects associating with this set-up, such as the so called 'Zoom fatigue', which was coined recently by some authors. In realising this problem, solutions were suggested in the literature to help trigger students engagement and enhance teachers experience in online teaching. This study analyses these effects along with our teachers experience in the new learning environment and concludes by devising some recommendations. To attain the above objectives, we conducted online interviews with six of our teachers, transcribed the content of the videos and then applied the inductive research approach to assess the results.	1362
Collective Intelligent Strategy for Improved Segmentation of COVID-19  from CT	Surochita Pal Das,Sushmita Mitra,B. Uma Shankar	2022/12/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12264v1	ArXiv	The devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic makes it imperative to design automated techniques for a fast and accurate detection. We propose a novel non-invasive tool, using deep learning and imaging, for delineating COVID-19 infection in lungs. The Ensembling Attention-based Multi-scaled Convolution network (EAMC), employing Leave-One-Patient-Out (LOPO) training, exhibits high sensitivity and precision in outlining infected regions along with assessment of severity. The Attention module combines contextual with local information, at multiple scales, for accurate segmentation. Ensemble learning integrates heterogeneity of decision through different base classifiers. The superiority of EAMC, even with severe class imbalance, is established through comparison with existing state-of-the-art learning models over four publicly-available COVID-19 datasets. The results are suggestive of the relevance of deep learning in providing assistive intelligence to medical practitioners, when they are overburdened with patients as in pandemics. Its clinical significance lies in its unprecedented scope in providing low-cost decision-making for patients lacking specialized healthcare at remote locations.	1363
A joint Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic  and subgenomic RNA viral dynamics and seroconversion	Tracy Q. Dong,Elizabeth R. Brown	2023/01/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03714v1	ArXiv	Understanding the viral dynamics and immunizing antibodies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for devising better therapeutic and prevention strategies for COVID-19. Here, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model that jointly estimates the diagnostic RNA viral load reflecting genomic materials of SARS-CoV-2, the subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) viral load reflecting active viral replication, and the rate and timing of seroconversion reflecting presence of antibodies. Our proposed method accounts for the dynamical relationship and correlation structure between the two types of viral load, allows for borrowing of information between viral load and antibody data, and identifies potential correlates of viral load characteristics and propensity for seroconversion. We demonstrate the features of the joint model through application to the COVID-19 PEP study and conduct a cross-validation exercise to illustrate the model's ability to impute the sgRNA viral trajectories for people who only had diagnostic viral load data.	1364
Gender and Prestige Bias in Coronavirus News Reporting	Rebecca Dorn,Yiwen Ma,Fred Morstatter,Kristina Lerman	2023/01/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11994v1	ArXiv	Journalists play a vital role in surfacing issues of societal importance, but their choices of what to highlight and who to interview are influenced by societal biases. In this work, we use natural language processing tools to measure these biases in a large corpus of news articles about the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, we identify when experts are quoted in news and extract their names and institutional affiliations. We enrich the data by classifying each expert's gender, the type of organization they belong to, and for academic institutions, their ranking. Our analysis reveals disparities in the representation of experts in news. We find a substantial gender gap, where men are quoted three times more than women. The gender gap varies by partisanship of the news source, with conservative media exhibiting greater gender bias. We also identify academic prestige bias, where journalists turn to experts from highly-ranked academic institutions more than experts from less prestigious institutions, even if the latter group has more public health expertise. Liberal news sources exhibit slightly more prestige bias than conservative sources. Equality of representation is essential to enable voices from all groups to be heard. By auditing bias, our methods help identify blind spots in news coverage.	1365
CovidExpert: A Triplet Siamese Neural Network framework for the  detection of COVID-19	Tareque Rahman Ornob,Gourab Roy,Enamul Hassan	2023/02/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09004v1	ArXiv	Patients with the COVID-19 infection may have pneumonia-like symptoms as well as respiratory problems which may harm the lungs. From medical images, coronavirus illness may be accurately identified and predicted using a variety of machine learning methods. Most of the published machine learning methods may need extensive hyperparameter adjustment and are unsuitable for small datasets. By leveraging the data in a comparatively small dataset, few-shot learning algorithms aim to reduce the requirement of large datasets. This inspired us to develop a few-shot learning model for early detection of COVID-19 to reduce the post-effect of this dangerous disease. The proposed architecture combines few-shot learning with an ensemble of pre-trained convolutional neural networks to extract feature vectors from CT scan images for similarity learning. The proposed Triplet Siamese Network as the few-shot learning model classified CT scan images into Normal, COVID-19, and Community-Acquired Pneumonia. The suggested model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.719%, a specificity of 99.36%, a sensitivity of 98.72%, and a ROC score of 99.9% with only 200 CT scans per category for training data.	1366
Hesitancy, Awareness and Vaccination: A Computational Analysis on  Complex Networks	Dibyajyoti Mallick,Aniruddha Ray,Ankita Das,Sayantari Ghosh	2023/02/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10474v1	ArXiv	Considering the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), around the world several vaccines are being developed. Till now, these vaccines are the most effective way to reduce the high burden on the global health infrastructure. However, the public acceptance towards vaccination is a crucial and pressing problem for health authorities. This study has been designed to determine the parameters affecting the decisions of common individuals towards COVID-19 vaccine. In our study, using the platforms of compartmental model and network simulation, we categorize people and observe their motivation towards vaccination in a mathematical social contagion process. In our model, we consider peer influence as an important factor in this dynamics, and study how individuals are influencing each other for vaccination. The efficiency of the vaccination process is estimated by the period of time required to vaccinate a substantial fraction of total population. We discovered the major barriers and drivers of this dynamics, and concluded that it is required to formulate specific strategies by the healthcare workers which could be more effective for the undecided and vaccine hesitant group of people.	1367
Global Pandemics Influence on Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes	Somya Khatri,Aswani Kumar Cherukuri,Firuz Kamalov	2023/02/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12462v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 has caused widespread damage across many areas of life and has made humans more dependent on the internet and technology making us realize the importance of secure remote working environments. While social separation is encouraged during moments of lockdown, online infrastructure has become the central focus for communication, commerce, working, and learning, creating a new challenge and trend for companies to adopt new methods and operating models. The cases of cyber-attacks increased, and fraudsters and cybercriminals took use of this to intensify their illegal activities by taking advantage of remote workers' vulnerabilities and the public's interest in information about the coronavirus. This paper examines the different types of security threats and cyber crimes that people faced in the pandemic time and the need for a safe and secure cyber infrastructure. This paper attempts to analyze the security implications of the issues.	1368
DECOR-NET: A COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Network Improved by  Emphasizing Low-level Features and Decorrelating Features	Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Xutao Guo,Ting Ma	2023/02/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14277v1	ArXiv	Since 2019, coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely spread and posed a serious threat to public health. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) holds great potential for screening and diagnosis of this disease. The segmentation of COVID-19 CT imaging can achieves quantitative evaluation of infections and tracks disease progression. COVID-19 infections are characterized by high heterogeneity and unclear boundaries, so capturing low-level features such as texture and intensity is critical for segmentation. However, segmentation networks that emphasize low-level features are still lacking. In this work, we propose a DECOR-Net capable of capturing more decorrelated low-level features. The channel re-weighting strategy is applied to obtain plenty of low-level features and the dependencies between channels are reduced by proposed decorrelation loss. Experiments show that DECOR-Net outperforms other cutting-edge methods and surpasses the baseline by 5.1% and 4.9% in terms of Dice coefficient and intersection over union. Moreover, the proposed decorrelation loss can improve the performance constantly under different settings. The Code is available at https://github.com/jiesihu/DECOR-Net.git.	1369
LaSER: Language-Specific Event Recommendation	Sara Abdollahi,Simon Gottschalk,Elena Demidova	2023/02/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04712v1	ArXiv	While societal events often impact people worldwide, a significant fraction of events has a local focus that primarily affects specific language communities. Examples include national elections, the development of the Coronavirus pandemic in different countries, and local film festivals such as the C\'esar Awards in France and the Moscow International Film Festival in Russia. However, existing entity recommendation approaches do not sufficiently address the language context of recommendation. This article introduces the novel task of language-specific event recommendation, which aims to recommend events relevant to the user query in the language-specific context. This task can support essential information retrieval activities, including web navigation and exploratory search, considering the language context of user information needs. We propose LaSER, a novel approach toward language-specific event recommendation. LaSER blends the language-specific latent representations (embeddings) of entities and events and spatio-temporal event features in a learning to rank model. This model is trained on publicly available Wikipedia Clickstream data. The results of our user study demonstrate that LaSER outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines by up to 33 percentage points in MAP@5 concerning the language-specific relevance of recommended events.	1370
Forecasting COVID-19 Infections in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  Countries using Machine Learning	Leila Ismail,Huned Materwala,Alain Hennebelle	2023/03/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07600v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 has infected more than 68 million people worldwide since it was first detected about a year ago. Machine learning time series models have been implemented to forecast COVID-19 infections. In this paper, we develop time series models for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries using the public COVID-19 dataset from Johns Hopkins. The dataset set includes the one-year cumulative COVID-19 cases between 22/01/2020 to 22/01/2021. We developed different models for the countries under study based on the spatial distribution of the infection data. Our experimental results show that the developed models can forecast COVID-19 infections with high precision.	1371
Wiki-based Communities of Interest: Demographics and Outliers	Hiba Arnaout,Simon Razniewski,Jeff Z. Pan	2023/03/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09189v2	ArXiv	In this paper, we release data about demographic information and outliers of communities of interest. Identified from Wiki-based sources, mainly Wikidata, the data covers 7.5k communities, such as members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and 345k subjects, e.g., Deborah Birx. We describe the statistical inference methodology adopted to mine such data. We release subject-centric and group-centric datasets in JSON format, as well as a browsing interface. Finally, we forsee three areas this research can have an impact on: in social sciences research, it provides a resource for demographic analyses; in web-scale collaborative encyclopedias, it serves as an edit recommender to fill knowledge gaps; and in web search, it offers lists of salient statements about queried subjects for higher user engagement.	1372
Rumour Detection and Analysis on Twitter	Yaohou Fan	2023/04/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01712v1	ArXiv	In recent years people have become increasingly reliant on social media to read news and get information, and some social media users post unsubstantiated information to gain attention. Such information is known as rumours. Nowadays, rumour detection is receiving a growing amount of attention because of the pandemic of the New Coronavirus, which has led to a large number of rumours being spread. In this paper, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system is built to predict rumours. The best model is applied to the COVID-19 tweets to conduct exploratory data analysis. The contribution of this study is twofold: (1) to compare rumours and facts using state-of-the-art natural language processing models in two dimensions: language structure and propagation route. (2) An analysis of how rumours differ from facts in terms of their lexical use and the emotions they imply. This study shows that linguistic structure is a better feature to distinguish rumours from facts compared to the propagation path. In addition, rumour tweets contain more vocabulary related to politics and negative emotions.	1373
MEDNC: Multi-ensemble deep neural network for COVID-19 diagnosis	Lin Yang,Shuihua Wang,Yudong Zhang	2023/04/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13135v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world for three years, but medical facilities in many areas still aren't adequate. There is a need for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis to identify high-risk patients and maximize the use of limited medical resources. Motivated by this fact, we proposed the deep learning framework MEDNC for automatic prediction and diagnosis of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) images. Our model was trained using two publicly available sets of COVID-19 data. And it was built with the inspiration of transfer learning. Results indicated that the MEDNC greatly enhanced the detection of COVID-19 infections, reaching an accuracy of 98.79% and 99.82% respectively. We tested MEDNC on a brain tumor and a blood cell dataset to show that our model applies to a wide range of problems. The outcomes demonstrated that our proposed models attained an accuracy of 99.39% and 99.28%, respectively. This COVID-19 recognition tool could help optimize healthcare resources and reduce clinicians' workload when screening for the virus.	1374
Check-COVID: Fact-Checking COVID-19 News Claims with Scientific Evidence	Gengyu Wang,Kate Harwood,Lawrence Chillrud,Amith Ananthram,Melanie Subbiah,Kathleen McKeown	2023/05/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18265v1	ArXiv	We present a new fact-checking benchmark, Check-COVID, that requires systems to verify claims about COVID-19 from news using evidence from scientific articles. This approach to fact-checking is particularly challenging as it requires checking internet text written in everyday language against evidence from journal articles written in formal academic language. Check-COVID contains 1, 504 expert-annotated news claims about the coronavirus paired with sentence-level evidence from scientific journal articles and veracity labels. It includes both extracted (journalist-written) and composed (annotator-written) claims. Experiments using both a fact-checking specific system and GPT-3.5, which respectively achieve F1 scores of 76.99 and 69.90 on this task, reveal the difficulty of automatically fact-checking both claim types and the importance of in-domain data for good performance. Our data and models are released publicly at https://github.com/posuer/Check-COVID.	1375
Pandemic Culture Wars: Partisan Differences in the Moral Language of  COVID-19 Discussions	Ashwin Rao,Siyi Guo,Sze-Yuh Nina Wang,Fred Morstatter,Kristina Lerman	2023/05/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18533v2	ArXiv	Effective response to pandemics requires coordinated adoption of mitigation measures, like masking and quarantines, to curb a virus's spread. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated, political divisions can hinder consensus on the appropriate response. To better understand these divisions, our study examines a vast collection of COVID-19-related tweets. We focus on five contentious issues: coronavirus origins, lockdowns, masking, education, and vaccines. We describe a weakly supervised method to identify issue-relevant tweets and employ state-of-the-art computational methods to analyze moral language and infer political ideology. We explore how partisanship and moral language shape conversations about these issues. Our findings reveal ideological differences in issue salience and moral language used by different groups. We find that conservatives use more negatively-valenced moral language than liberals and that political elites use moral rhetoric to a greater extent than non-elites across most issues. Examining the evolution and moralization on divisive issues can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of COVID-19 discussions and assist policymakers in better understanding the emergence of ideological divisions.	1376
Enhancing COVID-19 Diagnosis through Vision Transformer-Based Analysis  of Chest X-ray Images	Sultan Zavrak	2023/06/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06914v2	ArXiv	The advent of 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has engendered a momentous global health crisis, necessitating the identification of the ailment in individuals through diverse diagnostic modalities. Radiological imaging, particularly the deployment of X-ray imaging, has been recognized as a pivotal instrument in the detection and characterization of COVID-19. Recent investigations have unveiled invaluable insights pertaining to the virus within X-ray images, instigating the exploration of methodologies aimed at augmenting diagnostic accuracy through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The current research endeavor posits an innovative framework for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19, harnessing raw chest X-ray images, specifically by means of fine-tuning pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models. The developed models were appraised in terms of their binary classification performance, discerning COVID-19 from Normal cases, as well as their ternary classification performance, discriminating COVID-19 from Pneumonia and Normal instances, and lastly, their quaternary classification performance, discriminating COVID-19 from Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal conditions, employing distinct datasets. The proposed model evinced extraordinary precision, registering results of 99.92% and 99.84% for binary classification, 97.95% and 86.48% for ternary classification, and 86.81% for quaternary classification, respectively, on the respective datasets.	1377
Smartphones in a Microwave: Formal and Experimental Feasibility Study on  Fingerprinting the Corona-Warn-App	Henrik Graßhoff,Florian Adamsky,Stefan Schiffner	2023/07/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02931v1	ArXiv	Contact Tracing Apps (CTAs) have been developed to contain the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) spread. By design, such apps invade their users' privacy by recording data about their health, contacts, and partially location. Many CTAs frequently broadcast pseudorandom numbers via Bluetooth to detect encounters. These numbers are changed regularly to prevent individual smartphones from being trivially trackable. However, the effectiveness of this procedure has been little studied. We measured real smartphones and observed that the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA) exhibits a device-specific latency between two subsequent broadcasts. These timing differences provide a potential attack vector for fingerprinting smartphones by passively recording Bluetooth messages. This could conceivably lead to the tracking of users' trajectories and, ultimately, the re-identification of users.	1378
Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems and applications	J. de Lucas,X. Rivas,M. Zajac	2023/07/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06232v1	ArXiv	This paper provides a practical approach to stochastic Lie systems, i.e. stochastic differential equations whose general solutions can be written as a function depending only on a generic family of particular solutions and some constants, so as to emphasise their applications. We correct the known stochastic Lie theorem characterising stochastic Lie systems, proving that, contrary to previous claims, it satisfies the Malliavin's principle. Meanwhile, we show that stochastic Lie systems admit new stochastic features in the Ito approach. New generalisations of stochastic Lie systems, like the so-called stochastic foliated Lie systems, are devised. Subsequently, we focus on stochastic (foliated) Lie systems that can be studied as Hamiltonian systems using different types of differential geometric structures. We study their stability properties and we devise the basics of an energy-momentum method. A stochastic Poisson coalgebra method is developed to derive superposition rules for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. Applications of our results are found in coronavirus stochastic models, stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems, stochastic SIS models of different types, etc. Our results improve previous approaches by using stochastic differential equations instead of deterministic models designed to grasp some of their stochastic features.	1379
CIRO: COVID-19 infection risk ontology	Shusaku Egami,Yasunori Yamamoto,Ikki Ohmukai,Takashi Okumura	2023/08/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09719v1	ArXiv	Public health authorities perform contact tracing for highly contagious agents to identify close contacts with the infected cases. However, during the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this operation was not employed in countries with high patient volumes. Meanwhile, the Japanese government conducted this operation, thereby contributing to the control of infections, at the cost of arduous manual labor by public health officials. To ease the burden of the officials, this study attempted to automate the assessment of each person's infection risk through an ontology, called COVID-19 Infection Risk Ontology (CIRO). This ontology expresses infection risks of COVID-19 formulated by the Japanese government, toward automated assessment of infection risks of individuals, using Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) queries. For evaluation, we demonstrated that the knowledge graph built could infer the risks, formulated by the government. Moreover, we conducted reasoning experiments to analyze the computational efficiency. The experiments demonstrated usefulness of the knowledge processing, and identified issues left for deployment.	1380
Development of an intelligent system for the detection of corona virus  using artificial neural network	Nwafor Emmanuel O,Ngozi Maryrose Umeh,Ikechukwu Ekene Onyenwe	2023/09/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13636v1	ArXiv	This paper presents the development of an intelligent system for the detection of coronavirus using artificial neural network. This was done after series of literature review which indicated that high fever accounts for 87.9% of the COVID-19 symptoms. 683 temperature data of COVID-19 patients at >= 38C^o were collected from Colliery hospital Enugu, Nigeria and used to train an artificial neural network detective model for the detection of COVID-19. The reference model generated was used converted into Verilog codes using Hardware Description Language (HDL) and then burn into a Field Programming Gate Array (FPGA) controller using FPGA tool in Matlab. The performance of the model when evaluated using confusion matrix, regression and means square error (MSE) showed that the regression value is 0.967; the accuracy is 97% and then MSE is 0.00100Mu. These results all implied that the new detection system for is reliable and very effective for the detection of COVID-19.	1381
Deep Learning Models for Classification of COVID-19 Cases by Medical  Images	Amir Ali	2023/10/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16851v1	ArXiv	In recent times, the use of chest Computed Tomography (CT) images for detecting coronavirus infections has gained significant attention, owing to their ability to reveal bilateral changes in affected individuals. However, classifying patients from medical images presents a formidable challenge, particularly in identifying such bilateral changes. To tackle this challenge, our study harnesses the power of deep learning models for the precise classification of infected patients. Our research involves a comparative analysis of deep transfer learning-based classification models, including DenseNet201, GoogleNet, and AlexNet, against carefully chosen supervised learning models. Additionally, our work encompasses Covid-19 classification, which involves the identification and differentiation of medical images, such as X-rays and electrocardiograms, that exhibit telltale signs of Covid-19 infection. This comprehensive approach ensures that our models can handle a wide range of medical image types and effectively identify characteristic patterns indicative of Covid-19. By conducting meticulous research and employing advanced deep learning techniques, we have made significant strides in enhancing the accuracy and speed of Covid-19 diagnosis. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models and their potential to make substantial contributions to the global effort to combat COVID-19.	1382
Optimizing COVID-19 vaccine distribution adding spatio-temporal criteria	José Luis Sainz-Pardo,José Valero	2023/11/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18122v1	ArXiv	Massive vaccination against pandemics such as Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents several complexities. The criteria to assess public health policies are fundamental to distribute vaccines in an effective way in order to avoid as many infections and deaths as possible. Usually these policies are focused on determining socio-demographic groups of people and establishing a vaccination order among these groups.   This work focuses on optimizing the way of distributing vaccines among the different populations of a region for a period of time once established the priority socio-demographic groups. For this aim we use a SEIR model which takes into account vaccination. Also, for this model we prove theoretical results concerning the convergence of solutions on the long-term and the stability of fixed points and analyze the impact of an hypothetical vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemics in Spain.   After that, we introduce a heuristic approach in order to minimize the COVID-19 spreading by planning effective vaccine distributions among the populations of a region over a period of time. As an application, the impact of distributing vaccines in the Valencian Community (Spain) according to this method is computed in terms of the number of saved infected individuals.	1383
Exploring Content-Based and Meta-Data Analysis for Detecting Fake News  Infodemic: A case study on COVID-19	Oluwaseun Ajao,Ashish Garg,Marjory Da Costa-Abreu	2024/01/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08841v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is probably the most disruptive global health disaster in recent history. It negatively impacted the whole world and virtually brought the global economy to a standstill. However, as the virus was spreading, infecting people and claiming thousands of lives so was the spread and propagation of fake news, misinformation and disinformation about the event. These included the spread of unconfirmed health advice and remedies on social media. In this paper, false information about the pandemic is identified using a content-based approach and metadata curated from messages posted to online social networks. A content-based approach combined with metadata as well as an initial feature analysis is used and then several supervised learning models are tested for identifying and predicting misleading posts. Our approach shows up to 93% accuracy in the detection of fake news related posts about the COVID-19 pandemic	1384
Capacity Constraint Analysis Using Object Detection for Smart  Manufacturing	Hafiz Mughees Ahmad,Afshin Rahimi,Khizer Hayat	2024/01/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00243v1	ArXiv	The increasing popularity of Deep Learning (DL) based Object Detection (OD) methods and their real-world applications have opened new venues in smart manufacturing. Traditional industries struck by capacity constraints after Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) require non-invasive methods for in-depth operations' analysis to optimize and increase their revenue. In this study, we have initially developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based OD model to tackle this issue. This model is trained to accurately identify the presence of chairs and individuals on the production floor. The identified objects are then passed to the CNN based tracker, which tracks them throughout their life cycle in the workstation. The extracted meta-data is further processed through a novel framework for the capacity constraint analysis. We identified that the Station C is only 70.6% productive through 6 months. Additionally, the time spent at each station is recorded and aggregated for each object. This data proves helpful in conducting annual audits and effectively managing labor and material over time.	1385
Analyzing the Dynamics of COVID-19 Lockdown Success: Insights from  Regional Data and Public Health Measures	Md. Motaleb Hossen Manik,Md. Ahsan Habib,Md. Zabirul Islam,Tanim Ahmed,Fabliha Haque	2024/02/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18594v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus had a significant effect on social, economic, and health systems globally. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China, and spread worldwide resulting in severe disease, death, and social interference. Countries implemented lockdowns in various regions to limit the spread of the virus. Some of them were successful and some failed. Here, several factors played a vital role in their success. But mostly these factors and their correlations remained unidentified. In this paper, we unlocked those factors that contributed to the success of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored the correlations among them. Moreover, this paper proposes several strategies to control any pandemic situation in the future. Here, it explores the relationships among variables, such as population density, number of infected, death, recovered patients, and the success or failure of the lockdown in different regions of the world. The findings suggest a strong correlation among these factors and indicate that the spread of similar kinds of viruses can be reduced in the future by implementing several safety measures.	1386
Mobile Health Text Misinformation Identification Using Mobile Data  Mining	Wen-Chen Hu,Sanjaikanth E Vadakkethil Somanathan Pillai,Abdelrahman Ahmed ElSaid	2024/02/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19280v2	ArXiv	More than six million people died of the COVID-19 by April 2022. The heavy casualties have put people on great and urgent alert and people try to find all kinds of information to keep them from being inflected by the coronavirus. This research tries to find out whether the mobile health text information sent to peoples devices is correct as smartphones becoming the major information source for people. The proposed method uses various mobile information retrieval and data mining technologies including lexical analysis, stopword elimination, stemming, and decision trees to classify the mobile health text information to one of the following classes: (i) true, (ii) fake, (iii) misinformative, (iv) disinformative, and (v) neutral. Experiment results show the accuracy of the proposed method is above the threshold value 50 percentage, but is not optimal. It is because the problem, mobile text misinformation identification, is intrinsically difficult.	1387
COVID-19 Computer-aided Diagnosis through AI-assisted CT Imaging  Analysis: Deploying a Medical AI System	Demetris Gerogiannis,Anastasios Arsenos,Dimitrios Kollias,Dimitris Nikitopoulos,Stefanos Kollias	2024/03/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06242v2	ArXiv	Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems stand out as potent aids for physicians in identifying the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) through medical imaging modalities. In this paper, we showcase the integration and reliable and fast deployment of a state-of-the-art AI system designed to automatically analyze CT images, offering infection probability for the swift detection of COVID-19. The suggested system, comprising both classification and segmentation components, is anticipated to reduce physicians' detection time and enhance the overall efficiency of COVID-19 detection. We successfully surmounted various challenges, such as data discrepancy and anonymisation, testing the time-effectiveness of the model, and data security, enabling reliable and scalable deployment of the system on both cloud and edge environments. Additionally, our AI system assigns a probability of infection to each 3D CT scan and enhances explainability through anchor set similarity, facilitating timely confirmation and segregation of infected patients by physicians.	1388
Assessing COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness in Observational Studies via  Nested Trial Emulation	Justin B. DeMonte,Bonnie E. Shook-Sa,Michael G. Hudgens	2024/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18115v1	ArXiv	Observational data are often used to estimate real-world effectiveness and durability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. A sequence of nested trials can be emulated to draw inference from such data while minimizing selection bias, immortal time bias, and confounding. Typically, when nested trial emulation (NTE) is employed, effect estimates are pooled across trials to increase statistical efficiency. However, such pooled estimates may lack a clear interpretation when the treatment effect is heterogeneous across trials. In the context of COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness quite plausibly will vary over calendar time due to newly emerging variants of the virus. This manuscript considers a NTE inverse probability weighted estimator of vaccine effectiveness that may vary over calendar time, time since vaccination, or both. Statistical testing of the trial effect homogeneity assumption is considered. Simulation studies are presented examining the finite-sample performance of these methods under a variety of scenarios. The methods are used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 outcomes using observational data on over 120,000 residents of Abruzzo, Italy during 2021.	1389
Estimating the Number of Street Vendors in New York City	Jonathan Auerbach	2024/06/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00527v4	ArXiv	We estimate the number of street vendors in New York City. First, we summarize the process by which vendors receive licenses and permits to operate legally in New York City. Second, we describe a survey that was administered by the Street Vendor Project while distributing Coronavirus relief aid to vendors operating in New York City both with and without a license or permit. Third, we review ratio estimation and provide a theoretical justification based on the theory of point processes. Fourth, we use ratio estimation to calculate the total number of vendors, finding approximately 23,000 street vendors operate in New York City (20,500 mobile food vendors and 2,400 general merchandise vendors) with one third located in just six ZIP Codes (11368 (16%), 11372 (3%), and 11354 (3%) in North and West Queens and 10036 (5%), 10019 (4%), and 10001 (3%) in the Chelsea and Clinton neighborhoods of Manhattan). Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the ratio estimator when the distribution of vendors is explained by a Poisson or Yule process, and we discuss several policy implications. In particular, our estimates suggest the American Community Survey misses the majority of New York City street vendors.	1390
A Low-Rank Bayesian Approach for Geoadditive Modeling	Bryan Sumalinab,Oswaldo Gressani,Niel Hens,Christel Faes	2024/07/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05854v1	ArXiv	Kriging is an established methodology for predicting spatial data in geostatistics. Current kriging techniques can handle linear dependencies on spatially referenced covariates. Although splines have shown promise in capturing nonlinear dependencies of covariates, their combination with kriging, especially in handling count data, remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach to the low-rank representation of geoadditive models, which integrates splines and kriging to account for both spatial correlations and nonlinear dependencies of covariates. The proposed method accommodates Gaussian and count data inherent in many geospatial datasets. Additionally, Laplace approximations to selected posterior distributions enhances computational efficiency, resulting in faster computation times compared to Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques commonly used for Bayesian inference. Method performance is assessed through a simulation study, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The methodology is applied to the analysis of heavy metal concentrations in the Meuse river and vulnerability to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Belgium. Through this work, we provide a new flexible and computationally efficient framework for analyzing spatial data.	1391
Spatio-Temporal Variability of the Pepper Mild Mottle Virus Biomarker in  Wastewater	AnnaElaine L. Rosengart,Amanda L. Bidwell,Marlene K. Wolfe,Alexandria B. Boehm,F. William Townes	2024/08/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12012v1	ArXiv	Since the start of the coronavirus-19 pandemic, the use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for disease surveillance has increased throughout the world. Because wastewater measurements are affected by external factors, processing WBE data typically includes a normalization step in order to adjust wastewater measurements (e.g. viral RNA concentrations) to account for variation due to dynamic population changes, sewer travel effects, or laboratory methods. Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant RNA virus abundant in human feces and wastewater, has been used as a fecal contamination indicator and has been used to normalize wastewater measurements extensively. However, there has been little work to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of PMMoV in wastewater, which may influence the effectiveness of PMMoV for adjusting or normalizing WBE measurements. Here, we investigate its variability across space and time using data collected over a two-year period from sewage treatment plants across the United States. We find that most variation in PMMoV measurements can be attributed to longitude and latitude followed by site-specific variables. Further research into cross-geographical and -temporal comparability of PMMoV-normalized pathogen concentrations would strengthen the utility of PMMoV in WBE.	1392
Content Aware Analysis of Scholarly Networks: A Case Study on CORD19  Dataset	Mehmet Emre Akbulut,Yusuf Erdem Nacar	2024/10/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00262v2	ArXiv	This paper investigates the relationships among key elements of the scientific research network, namely articles, researchers, and journals. We introduce a novel approach to use semantic information through the HITS algorithm-based propagation of topic information in the network. The topic information is derived by using the Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linkage. In our case, MedCAT is used to extract the topics from the CORD19 Dataset, which is a corpus of academic articles about COVID-19 and the coronavirus scientific network. Our approach focuses on the COVID-19 domain, utilizing the CORD-19 dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of integrating topic-related information within the citation framework. Through the application of a hybrid HITS algorithm, we show that incorporating topic data significantly influences article rankings, revealing deeper insights into the structure of the academic community.	1393
MICA: Medical Intelligent Conversational AgentHow to optimize medical  teleconsultations for sports patients via a conversational agent?	Laurent Cervoni,Tonie Fares,Mehdi Roudesli	2024/11/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10465v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus crisis has increased medical teleconsultations (in France) by 10 times between 2019 and the first 3 months of 2020. However, the consultation and teleconsultation process have remained much the same. To improve the patient pathway and the efficiency of a session, we have developed a conversational assistant to optimize the time spent with the patient, the quality of the information transmitted to the physicians and thus the accuracy of diagnosis. One of the chatbot's interests is to give the physicians at the beginning of the consultation key elements for further inquiry. In this way, the system aims to help the patients concentrate and well describe their problem, which leads to more meaningful interactions with physicians and helps to enable them to operate more efficiently.	1394
Multi-scale phylodynamic modelling of rapid punctuated pathogen  evolution	Quang Dang Nguyen,Sheryl L. Chang,Carl J. E. Suster,Rebecca J. Rockett,Vitali Sintchenko,Tania C. Sorrell,Mikhail Prokopenko	2024/12/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03896v2	ArXiv	Computational multi-scale pandemic modelling remains a major and timely challenge. Here we identify specific requirements for a new class of pandemic models operating across three scales: (1) rapid pathogen evolution, punctuated by emergence of new variants, (2) human interactions within a heterogeneous population, and (3) public health responses which constrain individual actions to control the disease transmission. We then present a pandemic modelling framework satisfying these requirements and capable of simulating multi-scale dynamic feedback loops. The developed framework comprises a stochastic agent-based model of pandemic spread, coupled with a phylodynamic model of the within-host pathogen evolution. It is validated with a case study, modelling a rapid punctuated evolution of SARS-CoV-2, based on global and contemporary genomic surveillance data, during the COVID-19 transmission within a large heterogeneous population. We demonstrate that the model captures the essential features of the COVID-19 pandemic and the novel coronavirus evolution, while retaining computational tractability and scalability.	1395
Medical Imaging and Computational Image Analysis in COVID-19 Diagnosis:  A Review	Shahabedin Nabavi,Azar Ejmalian,Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam,Ahmad Ali Abin,Alejandro F. Frangi,Mohammad Mohammadi,Hamidreza Saligheh Rad	2020/10/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02154v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The disease presents with symptoms such as shortness of breath, fever, dry cough, and chronic fatigue, amongst others. Sometimes the symptoms of the disease increase so much they lead to the death of the patients. The disease may be asymptomatic in some patients in the early stages, which can lead to increased transmission of the disease to others. Many studies have tried to use medical imaging for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This study attempts to review papers on automatic methods for medical image analysis and diagnosis of COVID-19. For this purpose, PubMed, Google Scholar, arXiv and medRxiv were searched to find related studies by the end of April 2020, and the essential points of the collected studies were summarised. The contribution of this study is four-fold: 1) to use as a tutorial of the field for both clinicians and technologists, 2) to comprehensively review the characteristics of COVID-19 as presented in medical images, 3) to examine automated artificial intelligence-based approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis based on the accuracy and the method used, 4) to express the research limitations in this field and the methods used to overcome them. COVID-19 reveals signs in medical images can be used for early diagnosis of the disease even in asymptomatic patients. Using automated machine learning-based methods can diagnose the disease with high accuracy from medical images and reduce time, cost and error of diagnostic procedure. It is recommended to collect bulk imaging data from patients in the shortest possible time to improve the performance of COVID-19 automated diagnostic methods.	1396

Greene	2021/02/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01521v4	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in late 2019, has since spread around the world and infected hundreds of millions of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While this viral species was unknown prior to January 2020, its similarity to other coronaviruses that infect humans has allowed for rapid insight into the mechanisms that it uses to infect human hosts, as well as the ways in which the human immune system can respond. Here, we contextualize SARS-CoV-2 among other coronaviruses and identify what is known and what can be inferred about its behavior once inside a human host. Because the genomic content of coronaviruses, which specifies the virus's structure, is highly conserved, early genomic analysis provided a significant head start in predicting viral pathogenesis and in understanding potential differences among variants. The pathogenesis of the virus offers insights into symptomatology, transmission, and individual susceptibility. Additionally, prior research into interactions between the human immune system and coronaviruses has identified how these viruses can evade the immune system's protective mechanisms. We also explore systems-level research into the regulatory and proteomic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune response. Understanding the structure and behavior of the virus serves to contextualize the many facets of the COVID-19 pandemic and can influence efforts to control the virus and treat the disease.	1397
Estimation of temporal covariances in pathogen dynamics using Bayesian  multivariate autoregressive models	Colette Mair,Sema Nickbakhsh,Richard Reeve,Jim McMenamin,Arlene Reynolds,Rory Gunson,Pablo R Murcia,Louise Matthews	2016/11/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09063v4	ArXiv	It is well recognised that animal and plant pathogens form complex ecological communities of interacting organisms within their hosts. Although community ecology approaches have been applied to determine pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust inference of the epidemiological impact of pathogen interactions are lacking. Here we developed a novel statistical framework to identify statistical covariances from the infection time-series of multiple pathogens simultaneously. Our framework extends Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models to analyse multivariate time series data by accounting for within- and between-year dependencies in infection risk and incorporating a between-pathogen covariance matrix which we estimate. Importantly, our approach accounts for possible confounding drivers of temporal patterns in pathogen infection frequencies, enabling robust inference of pathogen-pathogen interactions. We illustrate the validity of our statistical framework using simulated data and applied it to diagnostic data available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions among specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community ecology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with important utility for public health planning and preparedness.	1398
Prediction of Potential Commercially Available Inhibitors against  SARS-CoV-2 by Multi-Task Deep Learning Model	Fan Hu,Jiaxin Jiang,Peng Yin	2020/03/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00728v3	ArXiv	The outbreak of COVID-19 caused millions of deaths worldwide, and the number of total infections is still rising. It is necessary to identify some potentially effective drugs that can be used to prevent the development of severe symptoms or even death for those infected. Fortunately, many efforts have been made, and several effective drugs have been identified. The rapidly increasing amount of data is of great help for training an effective and specific deep learning model. In this study, we propose a multi-task deep learning model for the purpose of screening commercially available and effective inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. First, we pretrained a model on several heterogenous protein-ligand interaction datasets. The model achieved competitive results on some benchmark datasets. Next, a coronavirus-specific dataset was collected and used to fine-tune the model. Then, the fine-tuned model was used to select commercially available drugs against SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Overall, twenty compounds were listed as potential inhibitors. We further explored the model interpretability and observed the predicted important binding sites. Based on this prediction, molecular docking was also performed to visualize the binding modes of the selected inhibitors.	1399
Understanding Epidemic Data and Statistics: A case study of COVID-19	Amirhoshang Hoseinpour Dehkordi,Majid Alizadeh,Pegah Derakhshan,Peyman Babazadeh,Arash Jahandideh	2020/03/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06933v1	ArXiv	The 2019-Novel-Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 116 countries (By March 12) and out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases. Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-19 reported cases show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-03-12; daily updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran are 80932, 7869, 12462 and 10075; respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy (2020-03-04), about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South Korea's rate of 0.76% (10 times lower than Italy) and China's 3.8% (50% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies that yield significant changes in the trend of cases. The lockdown policy in China and Italy (the effect observed after 11 days), Shutdown of all nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea and reducing working hours in Iran.	1400
The effect of interurban movements on the spatial distribution of  population in China	Jiachen Ye,Qitong Hu,Peng Ji,Marc Barthelemy	2020/03/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07276v1	ArXiv	Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective control strategies at a national level.	1401
Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics	Bnaya Gross,Zhiguo Zheng,Shiyan Liu,Xiaoqi Chen,Alon Sela,Jianxin Li,Daqing Li,Shlomo Havlin	2020/03/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08382v3	ArXiv	The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is spread world-wide since December 2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the first wave of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. We provide a comprehensive picture of the spatial propagation from Hubei to other provinces in China in terms of distance, population size, and human mobility and their scaling relations. Since strict quarantine has been usually applied between cities, more insight about the temporal evolution of the disease can be obtained by analyzing the epidemic within cities, especially the time evolution of the infection, death, and recovery rates which affected by policies. We study and compare the infection rate in different cities in China and provinces in Italy and find that the disease spread is characterized by a two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate is close to a constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection symptoms are observed. Then at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. The time evolution of the death and recovery rates also distinguish between these two stages and reflect the health system situation which could be overloaded.	1402
Trend analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and the rest of the  world	Albertine Weber,Flavio Ianelli,Sebastian Goncalves	2020/03/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09032v1	ArXiv	"The recent epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) that started in China has already been ""exported"" to more than 140 countries in all the continents, evolving in most of them by local spreading. In this contribution we analyze the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported. Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give interpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and conclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases, are not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started."	1403
Masked Face Recognition Dataset and Application	Zhongyuan Wang,Guangcheng Wang,Baojin Huang,Zhangyang Xiong,Qi Hong,Hao Wu,Peng Yi,Kui Jiang,Nanxi Wang,Yingjiao Pei,Heling Chen,Yu Miao,Zhibing Huang,Jinbi Liang	2020/03/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09093v2	ArXiv	In order to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, almost everyone wears a mask during coronavirus epidemic. This almost makes conventional facial recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access control, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at train stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces. Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present, there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end, this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95% accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry. Our datasets are available at: https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset.	1404
Large-Scale Screening of COVID-19 from Community Acquired Pneumonia  using Infection Size-Aware Classification	Feng Shi,Liming Xia,Fei Shan,Dijia Wu,Ying Wei,Huan Yuan,Huiting Jiang,Yaozong Gao,He Sui,Dinggang Shen	2020/03/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09860v1	ArXiv	The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a threatening risk for global public health. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 patients of CAP underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the segmentations of both infections and lung fields, which were used to extract location-specific features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method (iSARF) was proposed, in which subjects were automated categorized into groups with different ranges of infected lesion sizes, followed by random forests in each group for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded sensitivity of 0.907, specificity of 0.833, and accuracy of 0.879 under five-fold cross-validation. Large performance margins against comparison methods were achieved especially for the cases with infection size in the medium range, from 0.01% to 10%. The further inclusion of Radiomics features show slightly improvement. It is anticipated that our proposed framework could assist clinical decision making.	1405
Finding an Accurate Early Forecasting Model from Small Dataset: A Case  of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak	Simon James Fong,Gloria Li,Nilanjan Dey,Rubén González Crespo,Enrique Herrera-Viedma	2020/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10776v1	ArXiv	Epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many lives and economy damages. It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed...	1406
Modeling the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Brazil: results from a  Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model	Nuno Crokidakis	2020/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12150v2	ArXiv	The world evolution of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2 or simply COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic. The disease appeared in China in December 2019, and it has spread fast around the world, specially in european countries like Italy and Spain. The first reported case in Brazil was recorded in February 26, and after that the number of cases growed fast. In order to slow down the initial growth of the disease through the country, confirmed positive cases were isolated to not transmit the disease. To better understand the early evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil, we apply a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model to the analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health, obtained from February 26, 2020 through March 25, 2020. Based on analyical and numerical results, as well on the data, the basic reproduction number is estimated to $R_{0}=5.25$. In addition, we estimate that the ratio unidentified infectious individuals and confirmed cases at the beginning of the epidemic is about $10$, in agreement with previous studies. We also estimated the epidemic doubling time to be $2.72$ days.	1407
COVID-19 on Social Media: Analyzing Misinformation in Twitter  Conversations	Karishma Sharma,Sungyong Seo,Chuizheng Meng,Sirisha Rambhatla,Yan Liu	2020/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12309v4	ArXiv	The ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the inter-connectedness of our present-day globalized world. With social distancing policies in place, virtual communication has become an important source of (mis)information. As increasing number of people rely on social media platforms for news, identifying misinformation and uncovering the nature of online discourse around COVID-19 has emerged as a critical task. To this end, we collected streaming data related to COVID-19 using the Twitter API, starting March 1, 2020. We identified unreliable and misleading contents based on fact-checking sources, and examined the narratives promoted in misinformation tweets, along with the distribution of engagements with these tweets. In addition, we provide examples of the spreading patterns of prominent misinformation tweets. The analysis is presented and updated on a publically accessible dashboard (https://usc-melady.github.io/COVID-19-Tweet-Analysis) to track the nature of online discourse and misinformation about COVID-19 on Twitter from March 1 - June 5, 2020. The dashboard provides a daily list of identified misinformation tweets, along with topics, sentiments, and emerging trends in the COVID-19 Twitter discourse. The dashboard is provided to improve visibility into the nature and quality of information shared online, and provide real-time access to insights and information extracted from the dataset.	1408
Knowledge synthesis from 100 million biomedical documents augments the  deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors	AJ Venkatakrishnan,Arjun Puranik,Akash Anand,David Zemmour,Xiang Yao,Xiaoying Wu,Ramakrishna Chilaka,Dariusz K. Murakowski,Kristopher Standish,Bharathwaj Raghunathan,Tyler Wagner,Enrique Garcia-Rivera,Hugo Solomon,Abhinav Garg,Rakesh Barve,Anuli Anyanwu-Ofili,Najat Khan,Venky Soundararajan	2020/03/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12773v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all available biomedical knowledge to decode its mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission. Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes and olfactory epithelial cells are likely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, correlating with reported loss of sense of taste and smell as early indicators of COVID-19 infection, including in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Airway club cells, ciliated cells and type II pneumocytes in the lung, and enterocytes of the gut also express ACE2. This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.	1409
Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and prediction of the human  interactome	Andrea Vandelli,Michele Monti,Edoardo Milanetti,Riccardo Delli Ponti,Gian Gaetano Tartaglia	2020/03/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13655v4	ArXiv	Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells. Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the 3 and 5 prime ends are the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5 prime end has the strongest propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing nucleotides 23000-24000 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural level, while the region upstream varies significantly. These two sequences code for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and has the potential to bind sialic acids. Our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5 prime end can interact with proteins involved in viral RNA processing such as double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases, in addition to other high-confidence candidate partners. These interactions, previously reported to be also implicated in HIV, reveal important information on host-virus interactions. The list of transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome provides clues on the biological pathways associated with gene expression changes in human cells.	1410
COVID-19 infection and recovery in various countries: Modeling the  dynamics and evaluating the non-pharmaceutical mitigation scenarios	Yong Zhang,Xiangnan Yu,HongGuang Sun,Geoffrey R. Tick,Wei Wei,Bin Jin	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13901v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic radically impacts our lives, while the transmission/infection and recovery dynamics of COVID-19 remain obscure. A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed in the last three months (till 3/22/2020) in various provinces and metropolises in China. The model results revealed the space dependent transmission/infection rate and the significant spatiotemporal variation in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have responded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID-19 so far, although these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the maximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the different countries. In addition, a stochastic model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread, if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed and quarantined.	1411
COVID-19: A model for studying the evolution of contamination in Brazil	Rodrigo A. Schulz,Carlos H. Coimbra-Araújo,Samuel W. S. Costiche	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13932v4	ArXiv	"In the present article we introduce an epidemiological model for the investigation of the spread of epidemics caused by viruses. The model is applied specifically to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus (aka ""novel coronavirus""). The SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model is used as a basis for studying the evolution of the epidemic. Nevertheless, we have modified some of the model hypotheses in order to obtain an estimate of the contamination free of overestimated predictions. This extended model is then applied to the case of the recent advance of the epidemic in Brazil. In this regard, it is possible to obtain the evolution for the number of infectious significantly close to that provided by current data. Accordingly, we evaluate possible future scenarios for the disease spread. Regarding the population susceptibility, we consider different social behaviors in response to quarantine measures and precautions to avoid contagion. We conclude that the future scenario of the epidemic depends significantly on the social behavior adopted to date, as well as on the contagion control measures. The extent of such measures would be likely to cause thousands, millions or tens of millions of contaminations in the next few months."	1412
Dynamic Competing Risk Modeling COVID-19 in a Pandemic Scenario	Min Lu,Hemant Ishwaran	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13997v4	ArXiv	The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States has forced federal and local governments to implement containment measures. Moreover, the severity of the situation has sparked engagement by both the research and clinical community with the goal of developing effective treatments for the disease. This article proposes a time dynamic prediction model with competing risks for the infected individual and develops a simple tool for policy makers to compare different strategies in terms of when to implement the strictest containment measures and how different treatments can increase or suppress infected cases. Two types of containment strategies are compared: (1) a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of citizens for a long period; and (2) an adaptive containment strategy whose strict level changes across time. We consider how an effective treatment of the disease can affect the dynamics in a pandemic scenario. For illustration we consider a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases assuming a 4% mortality rate compared with a 2% mortality rate if a new drug is available. Our results show compared with a constant containment strategy, adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and reduce maximum daily number of cases. This, along with an effective treatment plan for the disease can minimize death rate.	1413
PANDA: Policy-aware Location Privacy for Epidemic Surveillance	Yang Cao,Shun Takagi,Yonghui Xiao,Li Xiong,Masatoshi Yoshikawa	2020/05/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00186v2	ArXiv	In this demonstration, we present a privacy-preserving epidemic surveillance system. Recently, many countries that suffer from coronavirus crises attempt to access citizen's location data to eliminate the outbreak. However, it raises privacy concerns and may open the doors to more invasive forms of surveillance in the name of public health. It also brings a challenge for privacy protection techniques: how can we leverage people's mobile data to help combat the pandemic without scarifying our location privacy. We demonstrate that we can have the best of the two worlds by implementing policy-based location privacy for epidemic surveillance. Specifically, we formalize the privacy policy using graphs in light of differential privacy, called policy graph. Our system has three primary functions for epidemic surveillance: location monitoring, epidemic analysis, and contact tracing. We provide an interactive tool allowing the attendees to explore and examine the usability of our system: (1) the utility of location monitor and disease transmission model estimation, (2) the procedure of contact tracing in our systems, and (3) the privacy-utility trade-offs w.r.t. different policy graphs. The attendees can find that it is possible to have the full functionality of epidemic surveillance while preserving location privacy.	1414
Estimation of COVID-19 spread curves integrating global data and  borrowing information	Se Yoon Lee,Bowen Lei,Bani K. Mallick	2020/05/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00662v5	ArXiv	Currently, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big threat to global health. The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, a joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.	1415
Quantifying human mobility behavior changes in response to  non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United  States	Yixuan Pan,Aref Darzi,Aliakbar Kabiri,Guangchen Zhao,Weiyu Luo,Chenfeng Xiong,Lei Zhang	2020/05/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01224v1	ArXiv	Ever since the first case of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in Wuhan, China, social distancing has been promoted worldwide, including the United States. It is one of the major community mitigation strategies, also known as non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, our understanding is remaining limited in how people practice social distancing. In this study, we construct a Social Distancing Index (SDI) to evaluate people's mobility pattern changes along with the spread of COVID-19. We utilize an integrated dataset of mobile device location data for the contiguous United States plus Alaska and Hawaii over a 100-day period from January 1, 2020 to April 9, 2020. The major findings are: 1) the declaration of the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak greatly encouraged social distancing and the mandatory stay-at-home orders in most states further strengthened the practice; 2) the states with more confirmed cases have taken more active and timely responses in practicing social distancing; 3) people in the states with fewer confirmed cases did not pay much attention to maintaining social distancing and some states, e.g., Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana, already began to practice less social distancing despite the high increasing speed of confirmed cases; 4) some counties with the highest infection rates are not performing much social distancing, e.g., Randolph County and Dougherty County in Georgia, and some counties began to practice less social distancing right after the increasing speed of confirmed cases went down, e.g., in Blaine County, Idaho, which may be dangerous as well.	1416
Fractional-order SEIQRDP model for simulating the dynamics of COVID-19  epidemic	Mohamed Bahloul,Abderrazak Chahid,Taous Meriem Laleg-Kirati	2020/05/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01820v2	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is known as the causative virus of outbreak pneumonia initially recognized in the mainland of China, late December 2019. COVID-19 reaches out to many countries in the world, and the number of daily cases continues to increase rapidly. In order to simulate, track, and forecast the trend of the virus spread, several mathematical and statistical models have been developed. Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Death-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model is one of the most promising dynamic systems that has been proposed for estimating the transmissibility of the COVID-19. In the present study, we propose a Fractional-order SEIQRDP model to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic. The Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate, and reliable framework for pandemic growth characterization. In fact, fractional-order operator is not local and consider the memory of the variables. Hence, it takes into account the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered cases growth. The results of the validation of the model using real COVID-19 data are presented, and the pertinence of the proposed model to analyze, understand, and predict the epidemic is discussed.	1417
Crucial Inflammatory Mediators and Efficacy of Drug Interventions in  Pneumonia Inflated COVID-19: An Invivo Mathematical Modelling Study	Bishal Chhetri,D. K. K. Vamsi,Vijay M. Bhagat,Ananth V. S.,Bhanu Prakash,Roshan Mandale,Swapna Muthusamy,Carani B Sanjeevi	2020/05/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02261v2	ArXiv	The virus SARS-COV-2 caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO. Currently, over 210 countries and territories have been affected. Careful, well-designed drugs and vaccine for the total elimination of this virus seem to be the need of the hour. In this context, the invivo mathematical modelling studies can be extremely helpful in understanding the efficacy of the drug interventions. These studies can also help understand the role of the crucial inflammatory mediators and the behaviour of immune response towards this novel coronavirus. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we study the invivo dynamics of Covid-19. The results obtained here are inline with some of the clinical findings for Covid-19. This invivo modelling study involving the crucial biomarkers of Covid-19 is the first of its kind and the results obtained from this can be helpful to researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians and doctors who are working in this field.	1418
CODA-19: Using a Non-Expert Crowd to Annotate Research Aspects on  10,000+ Abstracts in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset	Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang,Chieh-Yang Huang,Chien-Kuang Cornelia Ding,Yen-Chia Hsu,C. Lee Giles	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02367v5	ArXiv	This paper introduces CODA-19, a human-annotated dataset that codes the Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, and Other sections of 10,966 English abstracts in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. CODA-19 was created by 248 crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk within 10 days, and achieved labeling quality comparable to that of experts. Each abstract was annotated by nine different workers, and the final labels were acquired by majority vote. The inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa) between the crowd and the biomedical expert (0.741) is comparable to inter-expert agreement (0.788). CODA-19's labels have an accuracy of 82.2% when compared to the biomedical expert's labels, while the accuracy between experts was 85.0%. Reliable human annotations help scientists access and integrate the rapidly accelerating coronavirus literature, and also serve as the battery of AI/NLP research, but obtaining expert annotations can be slow. We demonstrated that a non-expert crowd can be rapidly employed at scale to join the fight against COVID-19.	1419
Quantifying the Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Mainland China Using  Human Mobility Data	Jizhou Huang,Haifeng Wang,Haoyi Xiong,Miao Fan,An Zhuo,Ying Li,Dejing Dou	2020/05/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03010v1	ArXiv	To contain the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Mainland China, the authorities have put in place a series of measures, including quarantines, social distancing, and travel restrictions. While these strategies have effectively dealt with the critical situations of outbreaks, the combination of the pandemic and mobility controls has slowed China's economic growth, resulting in the first quarterly decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since GDP began to be calculated, in 1992. To characterize the potential shrinkage of the domestic economy, from the perspective of mobility, we propose two new economic indicators: the New Venues Created (NVC) and the Volumes of Visits to Venue (V^3), as the complementary measures to domestic investments and consumption activities, using the data of Baidu Maps. The historical records of these two indicators demonstrated strong correlations with the past figures of Chinese GDP, while the status quo has dramatically changed this year, due to the pandemic. We hereby presented a quantitative analysis to project the impact of the pandemic on economies, using the recent trends of NVC and V^3. We found that the most affected sectors would be travel-dependent businesses, such as hotels, educational institutes, and public transportation, while the sectors that are mandatory to human life, such as workplaces, residential areas, restaurants, and shopping sites, have been recovering rapidly. Analysis at the provincial level showed that the self-sufficient and self-sustainable economic regions, with internal supplies, production, and consumption, have recovered faster than those regions relying on global supply chains.	1420
Adaptive Feature Selection Guided Deep Forest for COVID-19  Classification with Chest CT	Liang Sun,Zhanhao Mo,Fuhua Yan,Liming Xia,Fei Shan,Zhongxiang Ding,Wei Shao,Feng Shi,Huan Yuan,Huiting Jiang,Dijia Wu,Ying Wei,Yaozong Gao,Wanchun Gao,He Sui,Daoqiang Zhang,Dinggang Shen	2020/05/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03264v1	ArXiv	Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes an effective tool to assist the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and 96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP classification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.	1421
An Improved Method for the Fitting and Prediction of the Number of  COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Based on LSTM	Bingjie Yan,Xiangyan Tang,Boyi Liu,Jun Wang,Yize Zhou,Guopeng Zheng,Qi Zou,Yao Lu,Wenxuan Tu	2020/05/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03446v2	ArXiv	New coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has constituted a global pandemic and has spread to most countries and regions in the world. By understanding the development trend of a regional epidemic, the epidemic can be controlled using the development policy. The common traditional mathematical differential equations and population prediction models have limitations for time series population prediction, and even have large estimation errors. To address this issue, we propose an improved method for predicting confirmed cases based on LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) neural network. This work compared the deviation between the experimental results of the improved LSTM prediction model and the digital prediction models (such as Logistic and Hill equations) with the real data as reference. And this work uses the goodness of fitting to evaluate the fitting effect of the improvement. Experiments show that the proposed approach has a smaller prediction deviation and a better fitting effect. Compared with the previous forecasting methods, the contributions of our proposed improvement methods are mainly in the following aspects: 1) we have fully considered the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data, rather than single standardized data; 2) the improved parameter settings and evaluation indicators are more accurate for fitting and forecasting. 3) we consider the impact of the epidemic stage and conduct reasonable data processing for different stage.	1422
Modelling the downhill of the Sars-Cov-2 in Italy and a universal  forecast of the epidemic in the world	Gabriele Martelloni,Gianluca Martelloni	2020/05/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03455v2	ArXiv	In a previous article [1] we have described the temporal evolution of the Sars- Cov-2 in Italy in the time window February 24-April 1. As we can see in [1] a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total infected and the deaths. In this article our goal is to study the missing peak, i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries. We think that this trend could be useful for a future epidemic of this coronavirus.	1423
Fast and accurate detection of Covid-19-related pneumonia from chest  X-ray images with novel deep learning model	M. M. Ramadhan,A. Faza,L. E. Lubis,R. E. Yunus,T. Salamah,D. Handayani,I. Lestariningsih,A. Resa,C. R. Alam,P. Prajitno,S. A. Pawiro,P. Sidipratomo,D. S. Soejoko	2020/05/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04562v2	ArXiv	Background: Novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly worldwide. As recent radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data, the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is, 100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%, respectively.	1424
Modelling the Extremes of Seasonal Viruses and Hospital Congestion: The  Example of Flu in a Swiss Hospital	Setareh Ranjbar,Eva Cantoni,Valérie Chavez-Demoulin,Giampiero Marra,Rosalba Radice,Katia Jaton-Ogay	2020/05/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05808v1	ArXiv	"Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as ""seasonal viruses"" as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words, meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed through a simulation study."	1425
In silico comparison of spike protein-ACE2 binding affinities across  species; significance for the possible origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus	Sakshi Piplani,Puneet Kumar Singh,David A. Winkler,Nikolai Petrovsky	2020/05/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06199v2	ArXiv	The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has raised important questions about viral origin, mechanisms of zoonotic transfer to humans, whether companion or commercial animals can act as reservoirs for infection, and why there are large variations in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibilities across animal species. Powerful in silico modelling methods can rapidly generate information on newly emerged pathogens to aid countermeasure development and predict future behaviours. Here we report an in silico structural homology modelling, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulation study of the key infection initiating interaction between the spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 and its target, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from multiple species. Human ACE2 has the strongest binding interaction, significantly greater than for any species proposed as source of the virus. Binding to pangolin ACE2 was the second strongest, possibly due to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) being identical to pangolin CoV spike RDB. Except for snake, pangolin and bat for which permissiveness has not been tested, all those species in the upper half of the affinity range (human, monkey, hamster, dog, ferret) have been shown to be at least moderately permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting a correlation between binding affinity and permissiveness. Our data indicates that the earliest isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were surprisingly well adapted to human ACE2, potentially explaining its rapid transmission.	1426
A Cross-Domain Approach to Analyzing the Short-Run Impact of COVID-19 on  the U.S. Electricity Sector	Guangchun Ruan,Dongqi Wu,Xiangtian Zheng,Haiwang Zhong,Chongqing Kang,Munther A. Dahleh,S. Sivaranjani,Le Xie	2020/05/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06631v7	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread around the globe in 2020, with the U.S. becoming the epicenter of COVID-19 cases since late March. As the U.S. begins to gradually resume economic activity, it is imperative for policymakers and power system operators to take a scientific approach to understanding and predicting the impact on the electricity sector. Here, we release a first-of-its-kind cross-domain open-access data hub, integrating data from across all existing U.S. wholesale electricity markets with COVID-19 case, weather, cellular location, and satellite imaging data. Leveraging cross-domain insights from public health and mobility data, we uncover a significant reduction in electricity consumption across that is strongly correlated with the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, degree of social distancing, and level of commercial activity.	1427
Modeling and forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic in India	Kankan Sarkar,Subhas Khajanchi	2020/05/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07071v1	ArXiv	Background: The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic dilated rapidly throughout India. To end the global COVID-19 pandemic major behavioral, social distancing, contact tracing, and state interventions has been undertaken to reduce the outbreak and avert the persistence of the coronavirus in humans in India and worldwide. In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost priority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19.   Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India. Based on the estimated data our model predicts the evolution of epidemics and the end of SARS-CoV-2 and aids to evaluate the influence of different policies to control the spread of the diseases.   Findings: With the real data for infected individuals, we find the basic reproduction number $R_0$ for 17 states of India and overall India. A complete figure is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date. Our study reveals that the strict control measures implemented in India substantially mitigated the disseminate of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, model simulations predict that 95% reduction of outbreak on June 26, 2020 and 99% reduction of outbreak on July 26, 2020 in India.   Interpretation: Our model simulation demonstrates that the community-wide elimination of SARS-CoV-2 is possible by mitigating the social distancing and use essential precautions. Lockdown can be implemented strictly to prevent the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The model-based and parameter estimation of epidemic life cycle, and end dates, if can be done precisely, may decrease distress and over optimism and develop the mentality for all of us for the next stages of the outbreak evolution.	1428
The Dynamics of COVID-19 spread: Evidence from Lebanon	Omar El Deeb,Maya Jalloul	2020/05/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07251v3	ArXiv	We explore the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lebanon by adopting two different approaches: the STEIR model, which is a modified SEIR model accounting for the effect of travel, and a repeated iterations model. We fit available daily data since the first diagnosed case until the end of June 2020 and we forecast possible scenarios of contagion associated with different levels of social distancing measures and travel inflows. We determine the initial reproductive transmission rate in Lebanon and all subsequent dynamics. In the repeated iterations (RI) model we iterate the available data of currently infected people to forecast future infections under several possible scenarios of contagion. In both models, our results suggest that tougher mitigation measures would slow down the spread of the disease. On the other hand, the current relaxation of measures and partial resumption of international flights, as the STEIR reveals, would trigger a second outbreak of infections, with severity depending on the extent of relaxation. We recommend strong institutional and public commitment to mitigation measures to avoid uncontrolled spread.	1429
Accelerating drug repurposing for COVID-19 via modeling drug mechanism  of action with large scale gene-expression profiles	Lu Han,G. C. Shan,B. F. Chu,H. Y. Wang,Z. J. Wang,S. Q. Gao,W. X. Zhou	2020/05/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07567v2	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, emerged in China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread around the world. It is clearly urgent to fight COVID-19 at global scale. The development of methods for identifying drug uses based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development. However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024 drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important roles in identifying different drug functions. For the current COVID-19, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine achieve antiviral effects by inhibiting endocytosis, etc., and were classified to the same community. And Clomiphene in the same community inibited the entry of Ebola Virus, indicated a similar MoAs that could be reflected by cell image.	1430
Towards Characterizing COVID-19 Awareness on Twitter	Muhammad Saad,Muhammad Hassan,Fareed Zaffar	2020/05/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08379v3	ArXiv	The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly altered our lifestyles as we resort to minimize the spread through preventive measures such as social distancing and quarantine. An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures. This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its preventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (ie., Twitter) are frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19 by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that, we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related trends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3) the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19 preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social media usage can influence public behavior, which can be leveraged to better combat future pandemics.	1431
Effect of Lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 in Pakistan	Fizza Farooq,Javeria Khan,Muhammad Usman Ghani Khan	2020/05/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09422v1	ArXiv	A novel coronavirus originated from Wuhan, China in late December 2019 has now affected almost all countries worldwide. Pakistan reported its first case in late February. The country went to lockdown after three weeks since the first case, when the total number of cases were over 880. Pakistan imposed a lockdown for more than a month which slowed the spread of COVID 19 effectively, however in late April relaxation in lockdown was allowed by the government in stages to lift the strain on the economy. In this study, the data has been analyzed from daily situation reports by the National Institute of Health Pakistan and the effects of initial strict lockdown and later smart lockdown have been studied. Our analysis showed a 13.14 Percentage increase in cases before lockdown which drops down to 6.55 percent during the lockdown. It proved the effectiveness of lockdown. However, the Percentage Increase in case grows up to 7.24 during a smart lockdown. If it continues to rise in this manner, Pakistan may need to enter again into a strict second lockdown.	1432
Addressing selection bias and measurement error in COVID-19 case count  data using auxiliary information	Walter Dempsey	2020/05/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10425v3	ArXiv	Coronavirus case-count data has influenced government policies and drives most epidemiological forecasts. Limited testing is cited as the key driver behind minimal information on the COVID-19 pandemic. While expanded testing is laudable, measurement error and selection bias are the two greatest problems limiting our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic; neither can be fully addressed by increased testing capacity. In this paper, we demonstrate their impact on estimation of point prevalence and the effective reproduction number. We show that estimates based on the millions of molecular tests in the US has the same mean square error as a small simple random sample. To address this, a procedure is presented that combines case-count data and random samples over time to estimate selection propensities based on key covariate information. We then combine these selection propensities with epidemiological forecast models to construct a \emph{doubly robust} estimation method that accounts for both measurement-error and selection bias. This method is then applied to estimate Indiana's active infection prevalence using case-count, hospitalization, and death data with demographic information, a statewide random molecular sample collected from April 25--29th, and Delphi's COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey. We end with a series of recommendations based on the proposed methodology.	1433
Feeling Like It is Time to Reopen Now? COVID-19 New Normal Scenarios  based on Reopening Sentiment Analytics	Jim Samuel,Md. Mokhlesur Rahman,G. G. Md. Nawaz Ali,Yana Samuel,Alexander Pelaez	2020/05/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10961v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances. This research discovers public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the US economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time sensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new normal future.	1434
COVID-19: The unreasonable effectiveness of simple models	Timoteo Carletti,Duccio Fanelli,Francesco Piazza	2020/05/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11085v1	ArXiv	When the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) was officially declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the scientific community had already braced up in the effort of making sense of the fast-growing wealth of data gathered by national authorities all over the world. However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.	1435
What Can We Learn from the Time Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in  Slovenia?	Ioan Baldea	2020/05/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12367v1	ArXiv	A recent work (DOI 10.1101/2020.05.06.20093310) indicated that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate kappa by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the \k{appa}-value by ~15 % as compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein (justifiable) wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed. Significantly for behavioral and social science, our analysis of the time dependence \k{appa} = \k{appa}(t) may reveal an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement.	1436
Identifying the measurements required to estimate rates of COVID-19  transmission, infection, and detection, using variational data assimilation	Eve Armstrong,Manuela Runge,Jaline Gerardin	2020/05/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12441v2	ArXiv	We demonstrate the ability of statistical data assimilation to identify the measurements required for accurate state and parameter estimation in an epidemiological model for the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain accurate estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. Given a noiseless measurement of the recovered population, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 101 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. With low noise added to the recovered population, accurate state estimates require a lengthening of the temporal baseline of measurements. Estimates of all parameters are sensitive to the contamination, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. The aim of this paper is to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown parameters to a desired precision, in a model with the complexity required to capture important features of the COVID-19 pandemic.	1437
Social Distancing as a Network Population Game in a Socially Connected  World	Zhijun Wu	2020/05/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12506v2	ArXiv	While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different contact values are assigned to different network sites.	1438
Design of a Low-cost Miniature Robot to Assist the COVID-19  Nasopharyngeal Swab Sampling	Shuangyi Wang,Kehao Wang,Hongbin Liu,Zengguang Hou	2020/05/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12679v1	ArXiv	Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is an effective approach for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Medical staffs carrying out the task of collecting NP specimens are in close contact with the suspected patient, thereby posing a high risk of cross-infection. We propose a low-cost miniature robot that can be easily assembled and remotely controlled. The system includes an active end-effector, a passive positioning arm, and a detachable swab gripper with integrated force sensing capability. The cost of the materials for building this robot is 55 USD and the total weight of the functional part is 0.23kg. The design of the force sensing swab gripper was justified using Finite Element (FE) modeling and the performances of the robot were validated with a simulation phantom and three pig noses. FE analysis indicated a 0.5mm magnitude displacement of the gripper's sensing beam, which meets the ideal detecting range of the optoelectronic sensor. Studies on both the phantom and the pig nose demonstrated the successful operation of the robot during the collection task. The average forces were found to be 0.35N and 0.85N, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed robot is promising and could be further developed to be used in vivo.	1439
Analyzing COVID-19 on Online Social Media: Trends, Sentiments and  Emotions	Xiaoya Li,Mingxin Zhou,Jiawei Wu,Arianna Yuan,Fei Wu,Jiwei Li	2020/05/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14464v3	ArXiv	At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused severe impacts on society, economy and people's daily lives. People constantly express their opinions on various aspects of the pandemic on social media, making user-generated content an important source for understanding public emotions and concerns. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of the American people and the Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020. Specifically, by identifying people's sentiments, emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the emotional triggers (e.g., what a user is angry/sad about) we are able to depict the dynamics of public affect in the time of COVID-19. By contrasting two very different countries, China and the Unites States, we reveal sharp differences in people's views on COVID-19 in different cultures. Our study provides a computational approach to unveiling public emotions and concerns on the pandemic in real-time, which would potentially help policy-makers better understand people's need and thus make optimal policy.	1440
Shapley value confidence intervals for attributing variance explained	Daniel Fryer,Inga Strumke,Hien Nguyen	2020/01/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09593v2	ArXiv	The coefficient of determination, the $R^2$, is often used to measure the variance explained by an affine combination of multiple explanatory covariates. An attribution of this explanatory contribution to each of the individual covariates is often sought in order to draw inference regarding the importance of each covariate with respect to the response phenomenon. A recent method for ascertaining such an attribution is via the game theoretic Shapley value decomposition of the coefficient of determination. Such a decomposition has the desirable efficiency, monotonicity, and equal treatment properties. Under a weak assumption that the joint distribution is pseudo-elliptical, we obtain the asymptotic normality of the Shapley values. We then utilize this result in order to construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests regarding such quantities. Monte Carlo studies regarding our results are provided. We found that our asymptotic confidence intervals are computationally superior to competing bootstrap methods and are able to improve upon the performance of such intervals. In an expository application to Australian real estate price modelling, we employ Shapley value confidence intervals to identify significant differences between the explanatory contributions of covariates, between models, which otherwise share approximately the same $R^2$ value. These different models are based on real estate data from the same periods in 2019 and 2020, the latter covering the early stages of the arrival of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.	1441
An encoder-decoder-based method for COVID-19 lung infection segmentation	Omar Elharrouss,Nandhini Subramanian,Somaya Al-Maadeed	2020/07/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00861v2	ArXiv	The novelty of the COVID-19 disease and the speed of spread has created a colossal chaos, impulse among researchers worldwide to exploit all the resources and capabilities to understand and analyze characteristics of the coronavirus in term of the ways it spreads and virus incubation time. For that, the existing medical features like CT and X-ray images are used. For example, CT-scan images can be used for the detection of lung infection. But the challenges of these features such as the quality of the image and infection characteristics limitate the effectiveness of these features. Using artificial intelligence (AI) tools and computer vision algorithms, the accuracy of detection can be more accurate and can help to overcome these issues. This paper proposes a multi-task deep-learning-based method for lung infection segmentation using CT-scan images. Our proposed method starts by segmenting the lung regions that can be infected. Then, segmenting the infections in these regions. Also, to perform a multi-class segmentation the proposed model is trained using the two-stream inputs. The multi-task learning used in this paper allows us to overcome shortage of labeled data. Also, the multi-input stream allows the model to do the learning on many features that can improve the results. To evaluate the proposed method, many features have been used. Also, from the experiments, the proposed method can segment lung infections with a high degree performance even with shortage of data and labeled images. In addition, comparing with the state-of-the-art method our method achieves good performance results.	1442
Supporting Real-Time COVID-19 Medical Management Decisions: The  Transition Matrix Model Approach	Jian Chen,Michael C. Fu,Wenhong Zhang,Junhua Zheng	2020/07/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01201v1	ArXiv	Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, numerous forecasting models have been proposed to project the trajectory of coronavirus infection cases. We propose a new discrete-time Markov chain transition matrix model that directly incorporates stochastic behavior and for which parameter estimation is straightforward from available data. Using such data from China's Hubei province (for which Wuhan is the provincial capital city), the model is shown to be flexible, robust, and accurate. As a result, it has been adopted by the first Shanghai assistance medical team in Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, which was the first designated hospital to take COVID-19 patients in the world. The forecast has been used for preparing medical staff, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and other critical care medical resources and for supporting real-time medical management decisions. Empirical data from China's first two months (January/February) of fighting COVID-19 was collected and used to enhance the model by embedding NPI efficiency into the model. We applied the model to forecast Italy, South Korea, and Iran on March 9. Later we made forecasts for Spain, Germany, France, US on March 24. Again, the model has performed very well, proven to be flexible, robust, and accurate for most of these countries/regions outside China.	1443
From Fear to Hate: How the Covid-19 Pandemic Sparks Racial Animus in the  United States	Runjing Lu,Yanying Sheng	2020/07/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01448v1	ArXiv	We estimate the effect of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic on racial animus, as measured by Google searches and Twitter posts including a commonly used anti-Asian racial slur. Our empirical strategy exploits the plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of the first Covid-19 diagnosis across regions in the United States. We find that the first local diagnosis leads to an immediate increase in racist Google searches and Twitter posts, with the latter mainly coming from existing Twitter users posting the slur for the first time. This increase could indicate a rise in future hate crimes, as we document a strong correlation between the use of the slur and anti-Asian hate crimes using historic data. Moreover, we find that the rise in the animosity is directed at Asians rather than other minority groups and is stronger on days when the connection between the disease and Asians is more salient, as proxied by President Trump's tweets mentioning China and Covid-19 at the same time. In contrast, the negative economic impact of the pandemic plays little role in the initial increase in racial animus. Our results suggest that de-emphasizing the connection between the disease and a particular racial group can be effective in curbing current and future racial animus.	1444
A Weakly Supervised Consistency-based Learning Method for COVID-19  Segmentation in CT Images	Issam Laradji,Pau Rodriguez,Oscar Mañas,Keegan Lensink,Marco Law,Lironne Kurzman,William Parker,David Vazquez,Derek Nowrouzezahrai	2020/07/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02180v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread aggressively across the world causing an existential health crisis. Thus, having a system that automatically detects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the severity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires significant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling challenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each infected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to 10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels. However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images. The experiments on 3 open-source COVID-19 datasets show that this loss function yields significant improvement over conventional point-level loss functions and almost matches the performance of models trained with full supervision with much less human effort. Code is available at: \url{https://github.com/IssamLaradji/covid19_weak_supervision}.	1445
Detecting Topic and Sentiment Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Using  Social Media	Hui Yin,Shuiqiao Yang,Jianxin Li	2020/07/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02304v1	ArXiv	"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has greatly influenced people's daily lives across the globe. Emergent measures and policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts (e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like ``stay safe home"" are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as ``people death"" are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics."	1446
Predicting potential drug targets and repurposable drugs for COVID-19  via a deep generative model for graphs	Sumanta Ray,Snehalika Lall,Anirban Mukhopadhyay,Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay,Alexander Schönhuth	2020/07/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02338v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been creating a worldwide pandemic situation. Repurposing drugs, already shown to be free of harmful side effects, for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is an important option in launching novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, reliable molecule interaction data are a crucial basis, where drug-/protein-protein interaction networks establish invaluable, year-long carefully curated data resources. However, these resources have not yet been systematically exploited using high-performance artificial intelligence approaches. Here, we combine three networks, two of which are year-long curated, and one of which, on SARS-CoV-2-human host-virus protein interactions, was published only most recently (30th of April 2020), raising a novel network that puts drugs, human and virus proteins into mutual context. We apply Variational Graph AutoEncoders (VGAEs), representing most advanced deep learning based methodology for the analysis of data that are subject to network constraints. Reliable simulations confirm that we operate at utmost accuracy in terms of predicting missing links. We then predict hitherto unknown links between drugs and human proteins against which virus proteins preferably bind. The corresponding therapeutic agents present splendid starting points for exploring novel host-directed therapy (HDT) options.	1447
An Automated Contact Tracing Approach for Controlling Covid-19 Spread  Based on Geolocation Data from Mobile Cellular Networks	Md. Tanvir Rahman,Risala T. Khan,Muhammad R. A. Khandaker,Md. Sifat Ar Salan	2020/07/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02661v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus (COVID-19) has appeared as the greatest challenge due to its continuous structural evolution as well as the absence of proper antidotes for this particular virus. The virus mainly spreads and replicates itself among mass people through close contact which unfortunately can happen in many unpredictable ways. Therefore, to slow down the spread of this novel virus, the only relevant initiatives are to maintain social distance, perform contact tracing, use proper safety gears, and impose quarantine measures. But despite being theoretically possible, these approaches are very difficult to uphold in densely populated countries and areas. Therefore, to control the virus spread, researchers and authorities are considering the use of smartphone based mobile applications (apps) to identify the likely infected persons as well as the highly risky zones to maintain isolation and lockdown measures. However, these methods heavily depend on advanced technological features and expose significant privacy loopholes. In this paper, we propose a new method for COVID-19 contact tracing based on mobile phone users' geolocation data. The proposed method will help the authorities to identify the number of probable infected persons without using smartphone based mobile applications. In addition, the proposed method can help people take the vital decision of when to seek medical assistance by letting them know whether they are already in the list of exposed persons. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform the smartphone app-based solutions.	1448
A Vision-based Social Distancing and Critical Density Detection System  for COVID-19	Dongfang Yang,Ekim Yurtsever,Vishnu Renganathan,Keith A. Redmill,Ümit Özgüner	2020/07/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03578v2	ArXiv	Social distancing has been proven as an effective measure against the spread of the infectious COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, individuals are not used to tracking the required 6-feet (2-meters) distance between themselves and their surroundings. An active surveillance system capable of detecting distances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the deadly disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest (ROI) and modulating inflow can decrease social distancing violation occurrence chance.   On the other hand, recording data and labeling individuals who do not follow the measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies. Here we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and warning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system should never record/cache data, (2) the warnings should not target the individuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the detection/warning loop, and (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against this backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based real-time object detectors to measure social distancing. If a violation is detected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning signal is emitted without targeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure. Also, if the social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal to modulate inflow into the ROI. We tested the proposed method across real-world datasets to measure its generality and performance. The proposed method is ready for deployment, and our code is open-sourced.	1449
Segmentation of Pulmonary Opacification in Chest CT Scans of COVID-19  Patients	Keegan Lensink,Issam Laradji,Marco Law,Paolo Emilio Barbano,Savvas Nicolaou,William Parker,Eldad Haber	2020/07/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03643v2	ArXiv	The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread into a global pandemic. A form of pneumonia, presenting as opacities with in a patient's lungs, is the most common presentation associated with this virus, and great attention has gone into how these changes relate to patient morbidity and mortality. In this work we provide open source models for the segmentation of patterns of pulmonary opacification on chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans which have been correlated with various stages and severities of infection. We have collected 663 chest CT scans of COVID-19 patients from healthcare centers around the world, and created pixel wise segmentation labels for nearly 25,000 slices that segment 6 different patterns of pulmonary opacification. We provide open source implementations and pre-trained weights for multiple segmentation models trained on our dataset. Our best model achieves an opacity Intersection-Over-Union score of 0.76 on our test set, demonstrates successful domain adaptation, and predicts the volume of opacification within 1.7\% of expert radiologists. Additionally, we present an analysis of the inter-observer variability inherent to this task, and propose methods for appropriate probabilistic approaches.	1450
Giving Up Privacy For Security: A Survey On Privacy Trade-off During  Pandemic Emergency	Sajedul Talukder,Md. Iftekharul Islam Sakib,Zahidur Talukder	2020/07/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04109v1	ArXiv	While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be as complex as ever, the collection and exchange of data in the light of fighting coronavirus poses a major challenge for privacy systems around the globe. The disease's size and magnitude is not uncommon but it appears to be at the point of hysteria surrounding it. Consequently, in a very short time, extreme measures for dealing with the situation appear to have become the norm. Any such actions affect the privacy of individuals in particular. For some cases, there is intensive monitoring of the whole population while the medical data of those diagnosed with the virus is commonly circulated through institutions and nations. This may well be in the interest of saving the world from a deadly disease, but is it really appropriate and right? Although creative solutions have been implemented in many countries to address the issue, proponents of privacy are concerned that technologies will eventually erode privacy, while regulators and privacy supporters are worried about what kind of impact this could bring. While that tension has always been present, privacy has been thrown into sharp relief by the sheer urgency of containing an exponentially spreading virus. The essence of this dilemma indicates that establishing the right equilibrium will be the best solution. The jurisprudence concerning cases regarding the willingness of public officials to interfere with the constitutional right to privacy in the interests of national security or public health has repeatedly proven that a reasonable balance can be reached.	1451
Safer working spaces at coronavirus time: A novel use of antibody tests	Patricio Foncea,Susana Mondschein,Ragheb Massouh	2020/07/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05825v3	ArXiv	The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has transformed the way that the world functions. Health issues and population safety have driven countries' economies to a critical state; therefore, sustaining economic activity while keeping workers safe has become a worldwide goal. In this paper, we present a novel safety protocol based on rapid antibody testing (ABT). Using discrete event simulation, we evaluated its performance on the cumulative number of infected workers, effective reproductive number ($R_e$), and active work force within a company. Using a synthetic experiment, we showed that ABT twice a week (ABT 3) performed the best, detecting 5.7% of infected workers, compared to 16.9% when no ABT was applied. $R_e$ was reduced from 1.75 to 0.84, with a slight decrease in the active workers within the firm. A sensitivity analysis on the duration of the shedding period and sensitivity of ABT was performed and led to the same qualitative conclusions. We applied this protocol in a Chilean winery: the estimation of the initial $R_e$ of 1.3 was reduced to 0.7 when the ABT 3 protocol was implemented, with a 27% decrease in the number of infected workers. Although ABT is not approved for COVID-19 diagnosis, our study shows that upgraded safety standards can already be implemented in workspaces.	1452
A Weakly Supervised Region-Based Active Learning Method for COVID-19  Segmentation in CT Images	Issam Laradji,Pau Rodriguez,Frederic Branchaud-Charron,Keegan Lensink,Parmida Atighehchian,William Parker,David Vazquez,Derek Nowrouzezahrai	2020/07/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07012v1	ArXiv	One of the key challenges in the battle against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is to detect and quantify the severity of the disease in a timely manner. Computed tomographies (CT) of the lungs are effective for assessing the state of the infection. Unfortunately, labeling CT scans can take a lot of time and effort, with up to 150 minutes per scan. We address this challenge introducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that accelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning methods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision, but that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be redundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that promise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system allows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much cheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on open-source COVID-19 datasets show that using an entropy-based method to rank unlabeled regions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these regions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient than labeling whole images. Finally, we show that with only 7\% of the labeling effort required to label the whole training set gives us around 90\% of the performance obtained by training the model on the fully annotated training set.

Molecular mechanisms behind anti SARS-CoV-2 action of lactoferrin	Mattia Miotto,Lorenzo Di Rienzo,Leonardo Bò,Alberto Boffi,Giancarlo Ruocco,Edoardo Milanetti	2020/07/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07341v1	ArXiv	Despite the huge effort to contain the infection, the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has rapidly become pandemics, mainly due to its extremely high human-to-human transmission capability, and a surprisingly high viral charge of symptom-less people. While the seek of a vaccine is still ongoing, promising results have been obtained with antiviral compounds. In particular, lactoferrin is found to have beneficial effects both in preventing and soothing the infection. Here, we explore the possible molecular mechanisms with which lactoferrin interferes with SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion, preventing attachment and/or entry of the virus. To this aim, we search for possible interactions lactoferrin may have with virus structural proteins and host receptors. Representing the molecular iso-electron surface of proteins in terms of 2D-Zernike descriptors, we (i) identified putative regions on the lactoferrin surface able to bind sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane, sheltering the cell from the virus attachment; (ii) showed that no significant shape complementarity is present between lactoferrin and the ACE2 receptor, while (iii) two high complementarity regions are found on the N- and C-terminal domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, hinting at a possible competition between lactoferrin and ACE2 for the binding to the spike protein.	1454
AWS CORD-19 Search: A Neural Search Engine for COVID-19 Literature	Parminder Bhatia,Lan Liu,Kristjan Arumae,Nima Pourdamghani,Suyog Deshpande,Ben Snively,Mona Mona,Colby Wise,George Price,Shyam Ramaswamy,Xiaofei Ma,Ramesh Nallapati,Zhiheng Huang,Bing Xiang,Taha Kass-Hout	2020/07/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09186v3	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as a pandemic by WHO with thousands of cases being reported each day. Numerous scientific articles are being published on the disease raising the need for a service which can organize, and query them in a reliable fashion. To support this cause we present AWS CORD-19 Search (ACS), a public, COVID-19 specific, neural search engine that is powered by several machine learning systems to support natural language based searches. ACS with capabilities such as document ranking, passage ranking, question answering and topic classification provides a scalable solution to COVID-19 researchers and policy makers in their search and discovery for answers to high priority scientific questions. We present a quantitative evaluation and qualitative analysis of the system against other leading COVID-19 search platforms. ACS is top performing across these systems yielding quality results which we detail with relevant examples in this work.	1455
A curated collection of COVID-19 online datasets	Isa Inuwa-Dutse,Ioannis Korkontzelos	2020/07/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09703v1	ArXiv	One of the defining moments of the year 2020 is the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19), a deadly virus affecting the body's respiratory system to the point of needing a breathing aid via ventilators. As of June 21, 2020 there are 12,929,306 confirmed cases and 569,738 confirmed deaths across 216 countries, areas or territories. The scale of spread and impact of the pandemic left many nations grappling with preventive and curative approaches. The infamous lockdown measure introduced to mitigate the virus spread has altered many aspects of our social routines in which demand for online-based services skyrocketed. As the virus propagate, so does misinformation and fake news around it via online social media, which seems to favour virality over veracity. With a majority of the populace confined to their homes for a long period, vulnerability to the toxic impact of online misinformation is high. A case in point is the various myths and disinformation associated with the Covid-19, which, if left unchecked, could lead to a catastrophic outcome and hamper the fight against the virus.   While the scientific community is actively engaged in identifying the virus treatment, there is a growing interest in combating the associated harmful infodemic. To this end, researchers have been curating and documenting various datasets about Covid-19. In line with existing studies, we provide an expansive collection of curated datasets to support the fight against the pandemic, especially concerning misinformation. The collection consists of 3 categories of Twitter data, information about standard practices from credible sources and a chronicle of global situation reports. We describe how to retrieve the hydrated version of the data and proffer some research problems that could be addressed using the data.	1456
COVID-19 Data Analysis and Forecasting: Algeria and the World	Sami Belkacem	2020/07/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09755v2	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 has been leading the world into a prominent crisis. As of May 19, 2020, the virus had spread to 215 countries with more than 4,622,001 confirmed cases and 311,916 reported deaths worldwide, including Algeria with 7201 cases and 555 deaths. Analyze and forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths growth could be useful in many ways, governments could estimate medical equipment and take appropriate policy responses, and experts could approximate the peak and the end of the disease. In this work, we first train a time series Prophet model to analyze and forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Algeria based on the previously reported numbers. Then, to better understand the spread and the properties of the COVID-19, we include external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus, construct a dataset from reliable sources, and conduct a large-scale data analysis considering 82 countries worldwide. The evaluation results show that the time series Prophet model accurately predicts the number of cases and deaths in Algeria with low RMSE scores of 218.87 and 4.79 respectively, while the forecast suggests that the total number of cases and deaths are expected to increase in the coming weeks. Moreover, the worldwide data-driven analysis reveals several correlations between the increase/decrease in the number of cases and deaths and external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus such as geographic, climatic, health, economic, and demographic factors.	1457
Privacy-Preserving Multi-Operator Contact Tracing for Early Detection of  Covid19 Contagions	Davide Andreoletti,Omran Ayoub,Silvia Giordano,Massimo Tornatore,Giacomo Verticale	2020/07/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10168v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is imposing a severe worldwide lock-down. Contact tracing based on smartphones' applications (apps) has emerged as a possible solution to trace contagions and enforce a more sustainable selective quarantine. However, a massive adoption of these apps is required to reach the critical mass needed for effective contact tracing. As an alternative, geo-location technologies in next generation networks (e.g., 5G) can enable Mobile Operators (MOs) to perform passive tracing of users' mobility and contacts with a promised accuracy of down to one meter. To effectively detect contagions, the identities of positive individuals, which are known only by a Governmental Authority (GA), are also required. Note that, besides being extremely sensitive, these data might also be critical from a business perspective. Hence, MOs and the GA need to exchange and process users' geo-locations and infection status data in a privacy-preserving manner. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol that enables multiple MOs and the GA to share and process users' data to make only the final users discover the number of their contacts with positive individuals. The protocol is based on existing privacy-enhancing strategies that guarantee that users' mobility and infection status are only known to their MOs and to the GA, respectively. From extensive simulations, we observe that the cost to guarantee total privacy (evaluated in terms of data overhead introduced by the protocol) is acceptable, and can also be significantly reduced if we accept a negligible compromise in users' privacy.	1458
Future Smart Connected Communities to Fight COVID-19 Outbreak	Deepti Gupta,Smriti Bhatt,Maanak Gupta,Ali Saman Tosun	2020/07/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10477v2	ArXiv	Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly in the last decade and continue to develop in terms of dimension and complexity offering wide range of devices to support diverse set of applications. With ubiquitous Internet, connected sensors and actuators, networking and communication technology, and artificial intelligence (AI), smart cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide services rendering assistance to humans in their daily lives. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic has exposed and highlighted the limitations of current technological deployments to curtail this disease. IoT and smart connected technologies together with data-driven applications can play a crucial role not only in prevention, continuous monitoring, and mitigation of the disease, but also enable prompt enforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks. In this paper, we envision an IoT-enabled ecosystem for intelligent monitoring, pro-active prevention and control, and mitigation of COVID-19. We propose different architectures, applications and technology systems for various smart infrastructures including E-health, smart home, smart supply chain management, smart locality, and smart city, to develop future connected communities to manage and mitigate similar outbreaks. Furthermore, we present research challenges together with future directions to enable and develop these smart communities and infrastructures to fight and prepare against such outbreaks.	1459
CovidDeep: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Test Based on Wearable Medical Sensors  and Efficient Neural Networks	Shayan Hassantabar,Novati Stefano,Vishweshwar Ghanakota,Alessandra Ferrari,Gregory N. Nicola,Raffaele Bruno,Ignazio R. Marino,Kenza Hamidouche,Niraj K. Jha	2020/07/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10497v3	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic. The current testing regime based on Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-CoV-2 has been unable to keep up with testing demands, and also suffers from a relatively low positive detection rate in the early stages of the resultant COVID-19 disease. Hence, there is a need for an alternative approach for repeated large-scale testing of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. We propose a framework called CovidDeep that combines efficient DNNs with commercially available WMSs for pervasive testing of the virus. We collected data from 87 individuals, spanning three cohorts including healthy, asymptomatic, and symptomatic patients. We trained DNNs on various subsets of the features automatically extracted from six WMS and questionnaire categories to perform ablation studies to determine which subsets are most efficacious in terms of test accuracy for a three-way classification. The highest test accuracy obtained was 98.1%. We also augmented the real training dataset with a synthetic training dataset drawn from the same probability distribution to impose a prior on DNN weights and leveraged a grow-and-prune synthesis paradigm to learn both DNN architecture and weights. This boosted the accuracy of the various DNNs further and simultaneously reduced their size and floating-point operations.	1460
Internet of Things for Current COVID-19 and Future Pandemics: An  Exploratory Study	Mohammad Nasajpour,Seyedamin Pouriyeh,Reza M. Parizi,Mohsen Dorodchi,Maria Valero,Hamid R. Arabnia	2020/07/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11147v2	ArXiv	In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has drawn convincing research ground as a new research topic in a wide variety of academic and industrial disciplines, especially in healthcare. The IoT revolution is reshaping modern healthcare systems by incorporating technological, economic, and social prospects. It is evolving healthcare systems from conventional to more personalized healthcare systems through which patients can be diagnosed, treated, and monitored more easily. The current global challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel severe contagious respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presents the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. At the time this paper was written, the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases around the world had reached more than 31 million. Since the pandemic started, there has been a rapid effort in different research communities to exploit a wide variety of technologies to combat this worldwide threat, and IoT technology is one of the pioneers in this area. In the context of COVID-19, IoT enabled /linked devices/applications are utilized to lower the possible spread of COVID-19 to others by early diagnosis, monitoring patients, and practicing defined protocols after patient recovery. This paper surveys the role of IoT-based technologies in COVID-19 and reviews the state-of-the-art architectures, platforms, applications, and industrial IoT-based solutions combating COVID-19 in three main phases, including early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.	1461
Demystifying COVID-19 digital contact tracing: A survey on frameworks  and mobile apps	Tania Martin,Georgios Karopoulos,José L. Hernández-Ramos,Georgios Kambourakis,Igor Nai Fovino	2020/07/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11687v2	ArXiv	The coronavirus pandemic is a new reality and it severely affects the modus vivendi of the international community. In this context, governments are rushing to devise or embrace novel surveillance mechanisms and monitoring systems to fight the outbreak. The development of digital tracing apps, which among others are aimed at automatising and globalising the prompt alerting of individuals at risk in a privacy-preserving manner is a prominent example of this ongoing effort. Very promptly, a number of digital contact tracing architectures has been sprouted, followed by relevant app implementations adopted by governments worldwide. Bluetooth, and specifically its Low Energy (BLE) power-conserving variant has emerged as the most promising short-range wireless network technology to implement the contact tracing service. This work offers the first to our knowledge, full-fledged review of the most concrete contact tracing architectures proposed so far in a global scale. This endeavour does not only embrace the diverse types of architectures and systems, namely centralised, decentralised, or hybrid, but it equally addresses the client side, i.e., the apps that have been already deployed in Europe by each country. There is also a full-spectrum adversary model section, which does not only amalgamate the previous work in the topic, but also brings new insights and angles to contemplate upon.	1462
Daily Forecasting of New Cases for Regional Epidemics of Coronavirus  Disease 2019 with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification	Yen Ting Lin,Jacob Neumann,Ely Miller,Richard G. Posner,Abhishek Mallela,Cosmin Safta,Jaideep Ray,Gautam Thakur,Supriya Chinthavali,William S. Hlavacek	2020/07/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12523v1	ArXiv	To increase situational awareness and support evidence-based policy-making, we formulated two types of mathematical models for COVID-19 transmission within a regional population. One is a fitting function that can be calibrated to reproduce an epidemic curve with two timescales (e.g., fast growth and slow decay). The other is a compartmental model that accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a non-exponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating our models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case reporting. We infer new significant upward trends for five of the metropolitan areas starting between 19-April-2020 and 12-June-2020.	1463
Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the United States	Rui Wang,Jiahui Chen,Kaifu Gao,Yuta Hozumi,Changchuan Yin,Guo-Wei Wei	2020/07/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12692v1	ArXiv	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been mutating since it was first sequenced in early January 2020. The genetic variants have developed into a few distinct clusters with different properties. Since the United States (US) has the highest number of viral infected patients globally, it is essential to understand the US SARS-CoV-2. Using genotyping, sequence-alignment, time-evolution, $k$-means clustering, protein-folding stability, algebraic topology, and network theory, we reveal that the US SARS-CoV-2 has four substrains and five top US SARS-CoV-2 mutations were first detected in China (2 cases), Singapore (2 cases), and the United Kingdom (1 case). The next three top US SARS-CoV-2 mutations were first detected in the US. These eight top mutations belong to two disconnected groups. The first group consisting of 5 concurrent mutations is prevailing, while the other group with three concurrent mutations gradually fades out. Our analysis suggests that female immune systems are more active than those of males in responding to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We identify that one of the top mutations, 27964C$>$T-(S24L) on ORF8, has an unusually strong gender dependence. Based on the analysis of all mutations on the spike protein, we further uncover that three of four US SASR-CoV-2 substrains become more infectious. Our study calls for effective viral control and containing strategies in the US.	1464
COVID-19 Knowledge Graph: Accelerating Information Retrieval and  Discovery for Scientific Literature	Colby Wise,Vassilis N. Ioannidis,Miguel Romero Calvo,Xiang Song,George Price,Ninad Kulkarni,Ryan Brand,Parminder Bhatia,George Karypis	2020/07/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12731v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of over 350,000 people and infected more than 6 million people worldwide. Several search engines have surfaced to provide researchers with additional tools to find and retrieve information from the rapidly growing corpora on COVID-19. These engines lack extraction and visualization tools necessary to retrieve and interpret complex relations inherent to scientific literature. Moreover, because these engines mainly rely upon semantic information, their ability to capture complex global relationships across documents is limited, which reduces the quality of similarity-based article recommendations for users. In this work, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph (CKG), a heterogeneous graph for extracting and visualizing complex relationships between COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG combines semantic information with document topological information for the application of similar document retrieval. The CKG is constructed using the latent schema of the data, and then enriched with biomedical entity information extracted from the unstructured text of articles using scalable AWS technologies to form relations in the graph. Finally, we propose a document similarity engine that leverages low-dimensional graph embeddings from the CKG with semantic embeddings for similar article retrieval. Analysis demonstrates the quality of relationships in the CKG and shows that it can be used to uncover meaningful information in COVID-19 scientific articles. The CKG helps power www.cord19.aws and is publicly available.	1465
Digital Surveillance Systems for Tracing COVID-19: Privacy and Security  Challenges with Recommendations	Molla Rashied Hussein,Abdullah Bin Shams,Ehsanul Hoque Apu,Khondaker Abdullah Al Mamun,Mohammad Shahriar Rahman	2020/07/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13182v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019, i.e. COVID-19 has imposed the public health measure of keeping social distancing for preventing mass transmission of COVID-19. For monitoring the social distancing and keeping the trace of transmission, we are obligated to develop various types of digital surveillance systems, which include contact tracing systems and drone-based monitoring systems. Due to the inconvenience of manual labor, traditional contact tracing systems are gradually replaced by the efficient automated contact tracing applications that are developed for smartphones. However, the commencement of automated contact tracing applications introduces the inevitable privacy and security challenges. Nevertheless, unawareness and/or lack of smartphone usage among mass people lead to drone-based monitoring systems. These systems also invite unwelcomed privacy and security challenges. This paper discusses the recently designed and developed digital surveillance system applications with their protocols deployed in several countries around the world. Their privacy and security challenges are discussed as well as analyzed from the viewpoint of privacy acts. Several recommendations are suggested separately for automated contact tracing systems and drone-based monitoring systems, which could further be explored and implemented afterwards to prevent any possible privacy violation and protect an unsuspecting person from any potential cyber attack.	1466
Don't Fish in Troubled Waters! Characterizing Coronavirus-themed  Cryptocurrency Scams	Pengcheng Xia,Haoyu Wang,Xiapu Luo,Lei Wu,Yajin Zhou,Guangdong Bai,Guoai Xu,Gang Huang,Xuanzhe Liu	2020/07/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13639v2	ArXiv	As COVID-19 has been spreading across the world since early 2020, a growing number of malicious campaigns are capitalizing the topic of COVID-19. COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams are increasingly popular during the pandemic. However, these newly emerging scams are poorly understood by our community. In this paper, we present the first measurement study of COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams. We first create a comprehensive taxonomy of COVID-19 scams by manually analyzing the existing scams reported by users from online resources. Then, we propose a hybrid approach to perform the investigation by: 1) collecting reported scams in the wild; and 2) detecting undisclosed ones based on information collected from suspicious entities (e.g., domains, tweets, etc). We have collected 195 confirmed COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams in total, including 91 token scams, 19 giveaway scams, 9 blackmail scams, 14 crypto malware scams, 9 Ponzi scheme scams, and 53 donation scams. We then identified over 200 blockchain addresses associated with these scams, which lead to at least 330K US dollars in losses from 6,329 victims. For each type of scams, we further investigated the tricks and social engineering techniques they used. To facilitate future research, we have released all the well-labelled scams to the research community.	1467
CPAS: the UK's National Machine Learning-based Hospital Capacity  Planning System for COVID-19	Zhaozhi Qian,Ahmed M. Alaa,Mihaela van der Schaar	2020/07/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13825v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic poses the threat of overwhelming healthcare systems with unprecedented demands for intensive care resources. Managing these demands cannot be effectively conducted without a nationwide collective effort that relies on data to forecast hospital demands on the national, regional, hospital and individual levels. To this end, we developed the COVID-19 Capacity Planning and Analysis System (CPAS) - a machine learning-based system for hospital resource planning that we have successfully deployed at individual hospitals and across regions in the UK in coordination with NHS Digital. In this paper, we discuss the main challenges of deploying a machine learning-based decision support system at national scale, and explain how CPAS addresses these challenges by (1) defining the appropriate learning problem, (2) combining bottom-up and top-down analytical approaches, (3) using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, (4) integrating heterogeneous data sources, and (5) presenting the result with an interactive and transparent interface. CPAS is one of the first machine learning-based systems to be deployed in hospitals on a national scale to address the COVID-19 pandemic - we conclude the paper with a summary of the lessons learned from this experience.	1468
Real-Time Neural Network Scheduling of Emergency Medical Mask Production  during COVID-19	Chen-Xin Wu,Min-Hui Liao,Mumtaz Karatas,Sheng-Yong Chen,Yu-Jun Zheng	2020/07/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14055v1	ArXiv	During the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), there is a huge demand for medical masks. A mask manufacturer often receives a large amount of orders that are beyond its capability. Therefore, it is of critical importance for the manufacturer to schedule mask production tasks as efficiently as possible. However, existing scheduling methods typically require a considerable amount of computational resources and, therefore, cannot effectively cope with the surge of orders. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network for scheduling real-time production tasks. The neural network takes a sequence of production tasks as inputs to predict a distribution over different schedules, employs reinforcement learning to optimize network parameters using the negative total tardiness as the reward signal, and finally produces a high-quality solution to the scheduling problem. We applied the proposed approach to schedule emergency production tasks for a medical mask manufacturer during the peak of COVID-19 in China. Computational results show that the neural network scheduler can solve problem instances with hundreds of tasks within seconds. The objective function value (i.e., the total weighted tardiness) produced by the neural network scheduler is significantly better than those of existing constructive heuristics, and is very close to those of the state-of-the-art metaheuristics whose computational time is unaffordable in practice.	1469
COVID-19 CT Image Synthesis with a Conditional Generative Adversarial  Network	Yifan Jiang,Han Chen,Murray Loew,Hanseok Ko	2020/07/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14638v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic that has spread rapidly since December 2019. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for use in deep-learning-based medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and classification.	1470
Estimating the reciprocal of a binomial proportion	Jiajin Wei,Ping He,Tiejun Tong	2020/09/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00827v2	ArXiv	As a classic parameter from the binomial distribution, the binomial proportion has been well studied in the literature owing to its wide range of applications. In contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, also known as the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays an important role in various fields including clinical studies and random sampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers from the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been developed in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the optimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance comparison. Inspired by this, we propose to further advance the literature by developing an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of shrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas for the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation studies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or as well as, the existing competitors in most practical settings. Finally, to illustrate the usefulness of our new method, we also revisit a recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 data for assessing the relative risks of physical distancing on the infection of coronavirus, in which six out of seven studies encounter the zero-event problem.	1471
Understanding User Experience of COVID-19 Maps through Remote  Elicitation Interviews	Damla Çay,Till Nagel,Asım Evren Yantaç	2020/09/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01465v1	ArXiv	During the coronavirus pandemic, visualizations gained a new level of popularity and meaning for a wider audience. People were bombarded with a wide set of public health visualizations ranging from simple graphs to complex interactive dashboards. In a pandemic setting, where large amounts of the world population are socially distancing themselves, it becomes an urgent need to refine existing user experience evaluation methods for remote settings to understand how people make sense out of COVID-19 related visualizations. When evaluating visualizations aimed towards the general public with vastly different socio-demographic backgrounds and varying levels of technical savviness and data literacy, it is important to understand user feedback beyond aspects such as speed, task accuracy, or usability problems. As a part of this wider evaluation perspective, micro-phenomenology has been used to evaluate static and narrative visualizations to reveal the lived experience in a detailed way. Building upon these studies, we conducted a user study to understand how to employ Elicitation (aka Micro-phenomenological) interviews in remote settings. In a case study, we investigated what experiences the participants had with map-based interactive visualizations. Our findings reveal positive and negative aspects of conducting Elicitation interviews remotely. Our results can inform the process of planning and executing remote Elicitation interviews to evaluate interactive visualizations. In addition, we share recommendations regarding visualization techniques and interaction design about public health data.	1472
A free web service for fast COVID-19 classification of chest X-Ray  images	Jose David Bermudez Castro,Ricardo Rei,Jose E. Ruiz,Pedro Achanccaray Diaz,Smith Arauco Canchumuni,Cristian Muñoz Villalobos,Felipe Borges Coelho,Leonardo Forero Mendoza,Marco Aurelio C. Pacheco	2020/08/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01657v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus outbreak became a major concern for society worldwide. Technological innovation and ingenuity are essential to fight COVID-19 pandemic and bring us one step closer to overcome it. Researchers over the world are working actively to find available alternatives in different fields, such as the Healthcare System, pharmaceutic, health prevention, among others. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in the last 10 years, IA-based applications have become the prevalent solution in different areas because of its higher capability, being now adopted to help combat against COVID-19. This work provides a fast detection system of COVID-19 characteristics in X-Ray images based on deep learning (DL) techniques. This system is available as a free web deployed service for fast patient classification, alleviating the high demand for standards method for COVID-19 diagnosis. It is constituted of two deep learning models, one to differentiate between X-Ray and non-X-Ray images based on Mobile-Net architecture, and another one to identify chest X-Ray images with characteristics of COVID-19 based on the DenseNet architecture. For real-time inference, it is provided a pair of dedicated GPUs, which reduce the computational time. The whole system can filter out non-chest X-Ray images, and detect whether the X-Ray presents characteristics of COVID-19, highlighting the most sensitive regions.	1473
Surveying the side-chain network approach to protein structure and  dynamics: The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as an illustrative case	Anushka Halder,Arinnia Anto,Varsha Subramanyan,Moitrayee Bhattacharyya,Smitha Vishveshwara,Saraswathi Vishveshwara	2020/09/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04438v2	ArXiv	Network theory-based approaches provide valuable insights into the variations in global structural connectivity between differing dynamical states of proteins. Our objective is to review network-based analyses to elucidate such variations, especially in the context of subtle conformational changes. We present technical details of the construction and analyses of protein structure networks, encompassing both the non-covalent connectivity and dynamics. We examine the selection of optimal criteria for connectivity based on the physical concept of percolation. We highlight the advantages of using side-chain based network metrics in contrast to backbone measurements. As an illustrative example, we apply the described network approach to investigate the global conformational change between the closed and partially open states of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This conformational change in the spike protein is crucial for coronavirus entry and fusion into human cells. Our analysis reveals global structural reorientations between the two states of the spike protein despite small changes between the two states at the backbone level. We also observe some differences at strategic locations in the structures, correlating with their functions, asserting the advantages of the side-chain network analysis. Finally we present a view of allostery as a subtle synergistic-global change between the ligand and the receptor, the incorporation of which would enhance the drug design strategies.	1474
Network analysis and disease subnets for the SARS-CoV-2/Human  interactome	Beatriz Luna,Marcelino Ramírez,Edgardo Galán	2020/09/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06035v1	ArXiv	Motivation: With the aim to amplify and make sense of interactions of virus-human proteins in the case of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a structural analysis of the network of protein interactions obtained from the integration of three sources: 1) proteins of virus SARS-CoV-2, 2)physical interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins, 3) known interactions of these human proteins between them and the dossier of affections in which these proteins are implicated.   Results: As a product of this research, we present two networks, one from the interactions virus-host, and the other restricted to host-host, the last one is not usually considered for network analysis. We identified the most important proteins in both networks, those that have the maximal value of calculated invariants, these proteins are considered as the most: affected, connected or those that best monitor the flow of information in the network, among them we find UBC, a human protein related with ubiquination, linked with different stages of coronavirus disease, and ORF7A a virus protein that induces apoptosis in infected cells, associated with virion tethering. Using the constructed networks, we establish the more significant diseases corresponding with human proteins and their connections with other proteins. It is relevant that the identified diseases coincide with comorbidities, particularly the subnetwork of diabetes involves a great quantity of virus and human proteins (56%) and interactions (60%), this could explain the effect of this condition as an important cause of disease complications.	1475
Understanding Global Reaction to the Recent Outbreaks of COVID-19:  Insights from Instagram Data Analysis	Abdul Muntakim Rafi,Shivang Rana,Rajwinder Kaur,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Pooya Moradian Zadeh	2020/09/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06862v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease, also known as the COVID-19, is an ongoing pandemic of a severe acute respiratory syndrome. The pandemic has led to the cancellation of many religious, political, and cultural events around the world. A huge number of people have been stuck within their homes because of unprecedented lockdown measures taken globally. This paper examines the reaction of individuals to the virus outbreak-through the analytical lens of specific hashtags on the Instagram platform. The Instagram posts are analyzed in an attempt to surface commonalities in the way that individuals use visual social media when reacting to this crisis. After collecting the data, the posts containing the location data are selected. A portion of these data are chosen randomly and are categorized into five different categories. We perform several manual analyses to get insights into our collected dataset. Afterward, we use the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network for classifying the images associated with the posts, and attention-based LSTM networks for performing the caption classification. This paper discovers a range of emerging norms on social media in global crisis moments. The obtained results indicate that our proposed methodology can be used to automate the sentiment analysis of mass people using Instagram data.	1476
Trust Concerns in Health Apps collecting Personally Identifiable  Information during COVID-19-like Zoonosis	Molla Rashied Hussein,Md. Ashikur Rahman,Md. Jahidul Hassan Mojumder,Shakib Ahmed,Samia Naz Isha,Shaila Akter,Abdullah Bin Shams,Ehsanul Hoque Apu	2020/09/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07403v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19 in short, is a zoonosis, i.e., a disease that spreads from animals to humans. Due to its highly epizootic nature, it has compelled the public health experts to deploy smartphone applications to trace its rapid transmission pattern along with the infected persons as well by utilizing the persons' personally identifiable information. However, these information may summon several undesirable provocations towards the technical experts in terms of privacy and cyber security, particularly the trust concerns. If not resolved by now, the circumstances will affect the mass level population through inadequate usage of the health applications in the smartphones and thus liberate the forgery of a catastrophe for another COVID-19-like zoonosis to come. Therefore, an extensive study was required to address this severe issue. This paper has fulfilled the study mentioned above needed by not only discussing the recently designed and developed health applications all over the regions around the world but also investigating their usefulness and limitations. The trust defiance is identified as well as scrutinized from the viewpoint of an end-user. Several recommendations are suggested in the later part of this paper to leverage awareness among the ordinary individuals.	1477
Contrastive Cross-site Learning with Redesigned Net for COVID-19 CT  Classification	Zhao Wang,Quande Liu,Qi Dou	2020/09/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07652v1	ArXiv	The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lead to a global public health crisis spreading hundreds of countries. With the continuous growth of new infections, developing automated tools for COVID-19 identification with CT image is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. To enlarge the datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and generalizable models. This paper proposes a novel joint learning framework to perform accurate COVID-19 identification by effectively learning with heterogeneous datasets with distribution discrepancy. We build a powerful backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently improves the performances on both datasets, outperforming the original COVID-Net trained on each dataset by 12.16% and 14.23% in AUC respectively, also exceeding existing state-of-the-art multi-site learning methods.	1478
The Relationship between Deteriorating Mental Health Conditions and  Longitudinal Behavioral Changes in Google and YouTube Usages among College  Students in the United States during COVID-19: Observational Study	Anis Zaman,Boyu Zhang,Ehsan Hoque,Vincent Silenzio,Henry Kautz	2020/09/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09076v1	ArXiv	Mental health problems among the global population are worsened during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). How individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in mental health profiles in a non-invasive manner. The goal of this study is to examine, among college students, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of 49 students from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included late-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.	1479
Cross-Modal Alignment with Mixture Experts Neural Network for  Intral-City Retail Recommendation	Po Li,Lei Li,Yan Fu,Jun Rong,Yu Zhang	2020/09/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09926v1	ArXiv	In this paper, we introduce Cross-modal Alignment with mixture experts Neural Network (CameNN) recommendation model for intral-city retail industry, which aims to provide fresh foods and groceries retailing within 5 hours delivery service arising for the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic around the world. We propose CameNN, which is a multi-task model with three tasks including Image to Text Alignment (ITA) task, Text to Image Alignment (TIA) task and CVR prediction task. We use pre-trained BERT to generate the text embedding and pre-trained InceptionV4 to generate image patch embedding (each image is split into small patches with the same pixels and treat each patch as an image token). Softmax gating networks follow to learn the weight of each transformer expert output and choose only a subset of experts conditioned on the input. Then transformer encoder is applied as the share-bottom layer to learn all input features' shared interaction. Next, mixture of transformer experts (MoE) layer is implemented to model different aspects of tasks. At top of the MoE layer, we deploy a transformer layer for each task as task tower to learn task-specific information. On the real word intra-city dataset, experiments demonstrate CameNN outperform baselines and achieve significant improvements on the image and text representation. In practice, we applied CameNN on CVR prediction in our intra-city recommender system which is one of the leading intra-city platforms operated in China.	1480
CCBlock: An Effective Use of Deep Learning for Automatic Diagnosis of  COVID-19 Using X-Ray Images	Ali Al-Bawi,Karrar Ali Al-Kaabi,Mohammed Jeryo,Ahmad Al-Fatlawi	2020/09/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10141v1	ArXiv	Propose: Troubling countries one after another, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected the health and well-being of the world's population. The disease may continue to persist more extensively due to the increasing number of new cases daily, the rapid spread of the virus, and delay in the PCR analysis results. Therefore, it is necessary to consider developing assistive methods for detecting and diagnosing the COVID-19 to eradicate the spread of the novel coronavirus among people. Based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), automated detection systems have shown promising results of diagnosing patients with the COVID-19 through radiography; thus, they are introduced as a workable solution to the COVID-19 diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Based on the enhancement of the classical visual geometry group (VGG) network with the convolutional COVID block (CCBlock), an efficient screening model was proposed in this study to diagnose and distinguish patients with the COVID-19 from those with pneumonia and the healthy people through radiography. The model testing dataset included 1,828 x-ray images available on public platforms. 310 images were showing confirmed COVID-19 cases, 864 images indicating pneumonia cases, and 654 images showing healthy people. Results: According to the test results, enhancing the classical VGG network with radiography provided the highest diagnosis performance and overall accuracy of 98.52% for two classes as well as accuracy of 95.34% for three classes. Conclusions: According to the results, using the enhanced VGG deep neural network can help radiologists automatically diagnose the COVID-19 through radiography.	1481
Classification of COVID-19 in CT Scans using Multi-Source Transfer  Learning	Alejandro R. Martinez	2020/09/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10474v1	ArXiv	Since December of 2019, novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread around the world infecting millions of people and upending the global economy. One of the driving reasons behind its high rate of infection is due to the unreliability and lack of RT-PCR testing. At times the turnaround results span as long as a couple of days, only to yield a roughly 70% sensitivity rate. As an alternative, recent research has investigated the use of Computer Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. Due to an inherent lack of available COVID-19 CT data, these research efforts have been forced to leverage the use of Transfer Learning. This commonly employed Deep Learning technique has shown to improve model performance on tasks with relatively small amounts of data, as long as the Source feature space somewhat resembles the Target feature space. Unfortunately, a lack of similarity is often encountered in the classification of medical images as publicly available Source datasets usually lack the visual features found in medical images. In this study, we propose the use of Multi-Source Transfer Learning (MSTL) to improve upon traditional Transfer Learning for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. With our multi-source fine-tuning approach, our models outperformed baseline models fine-tuned with ImageNet. We additionally, propose an unsupervised label creation process, which enhances the performance of our Deep Residual Networks. Our best performing model was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.893 and a Recall score of 0.897, outperforming its baseline Recall score by 9.3%.	1482
Drug repurposing for COVID-19 using graph neural network and harmonizing  multiple evidence	Kanglin Hsieh,Yinyin Wang,Luyao Chen,Zhongming Zhao,Sean Savitz,Xiaoqian Jiang,Jing Tang,Yejin Kim	2020/09/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10931v3	ArXiv	Amid the pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infected by SARS-CoV-2, a vast amount of drug research for prevention and treatment has been quickly conducted, but these efforts have been unsuccessful thus far. Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a drug repurposing pipeline that systematically integrates multiple SARS-CoV-2 and drug interactions, deep graph neural networks, and in-vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all the available drugs (n= 3,635) involved in COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a SARS-CoV-2 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and electronic health records. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. In summary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deep neural networks, and rigorous validation can facilitate the rapid identification of candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

An Attention Mechanism with Multiple Knowledge Sources for COVID-19  Detection from CT Images	Duy M. H. Nguyen,Duy M. Nguyen,Huong Vu,Binh T. Nguyen,Fabrizio Nunnari,Daniel Sonntag	2020/09/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11008v4	ArXiv	Until now, Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 850,000 deaths and infected more than 27 million individuals in over 120 countries. Besides principal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, automatically identifying positive samples based on computed tomography (CT) scans can present a promising option in the early diagnosis of COVID-19. Recently, there have been increasing efforts to utilize deep networks for COVID-19 diagnosis based on CT scans. While these approaches mostly focus on introducing novel architectures, transfer learning techniques, or construction large scale data, we propose a novel strategy to improve the performance of several baselines by leveraging multiple useful information sources relevant to doctors' judgments. Specifically, infected regions and heat maps extracted from learned networks are integrated with the global image via an attention mechanism during the learning process. This procedure not only makes our system more robust to noise but also guides the network focusing on local lesion areas. Extensive experiments illustrate the superior performance of our approach compared to recent baselines. Furthermore, our learned network guidance presents an explainable feature to doctors as we can understand the connection between input and output in a grey-box model.	1484
The seesaw impacts between reduced emissions and enhanced AOC on O$_3$  during the COVID-19	Shengqiang Zhu,James Poetzscher,Juanyong Shen,Siyu Wang,Peng Wang,Hongliang Zhang	2020/09/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11714v1	ArXiv	Due to the lockdown measures during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the economic activities and the associated emissions have significantly declined. This reduction in emissions has created a natural experiment to assess the impact of the emitted precursor control policy on ozone (O$_3$) pollution, which has become a public concern in China during the last decade. In this study, we utilized comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented chemical transport modeling to investigate the O$_3$ variations during the COVID-19 in China. Here we found that the O$_3$ formation regime shifted from a VOC-limited regime to a NOx-limited regime due to the lower NOx during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, instead of these changes of the O$_3$ formation region, the significant elevated O$_3$ in the North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidant capacity (AOC) in these regions, which was different from previous studies. We suggest that future O$_3$ control policies should comprehensively consider the synergistic effects of O$_3$ formation regime and AOC on the O$_3$ elevation.	1485
Assessing the Interplay between travel patterns and SARS-CoV-2 outbreak  in realistic urban setting	Rohan Patil,Raviraj Dave,Harsh Patel,Viraj M Shah,Deep Chakrabarti,Udit Bhatia	2020/09/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12076v1	ArXiv	The dense social contact networks and high mobility in congested urban areas facilitate the rapid transmission of infectious diseases. Typical mechanistic epidemiological models are either based on uniform mixing with ad-hoc contact processes or need real-time or archived population mobility data to simulate the social networks. However, the rapid and global transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to unprecedented lockdowns at global and regional scales, leaving the archived datasets to limited use. While it is often hypothesized that population density is a significant driver in disease propagation, the disparate disease trajectories and infection rates exhibited by the different cities with comparable densities require a high-resolution description of the disease and its drivers. In this study, we explore the impact of the creation of containment zones on travel patterns within the city. Further, we use a dynamical network-based infectious disease model to understand the key drivers of disease spread at sub-kilometer scales demonstrated in the city of Ahmedabad, India, which has been classified as a SARS-CoV-2 hotspot. We find that in addition to the contact network and population density, road connectivity patterns and ease of transit are strongly correlated with the rate of transmission of the disease. Given the limited access to real-time traffic data during lockdowns, we generate road connectivity networks using open-source imageries and travel patterns from open-source surveys and government reports. Within the proposed framework, we then analyze the relative merits of social distancing, enforced lockdowns, and enhanced testing and quarantining mitigating the disease spread.	1486
Pandemics are catalysts of scientific novelty: Evidence from COVID-19	Meijun Liu,Yi Bu,Chongyan Chen,Jian Xu,Daifeng Li,Yan Leng,Richard Barry Freeman,Eric Meyer,Wonjin Yoon,Mujeen Sung,Minbyul Jeong,Jinhyuk Lee,Jaewoo Kang,Chao Min,Min Song,Yujia Zhai,Ying Ding	2020/09/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12500v3	ArXiv	Scientific novelty drives the efforts to invent new vaccines and solutions during the pandemic. First-time collaboration and international collaboration are two pivotal channels to expand teams' search activities for a broader scope of resources required to address the global challenge, which might facilitate the generation of novel ideas. Our analysis of 98,981 coronavirus papers suggests that scientific novelty measured by the BioBERT model that is pre-trained on 29 million PubMed articles, and first-time collaboration increased after the outbreak of COVID-19, and international collaboration witnessed a sudden decrease. During COVID-19, papers with more first-time collaboration were found to be more novel and international collaboration did not hamper novelty as it had done in the normal periods. The findings suggest the necessity of reaching out for distant resources and the importance of maintaining a collaborative scientific community beyond nationalism during a pandemic.	1487
Analysing the impact of global demographic characteristics over the  COVID-19 spread using class rule mining and pattern matching	Wasiq Khan,Abir Hussain,Sohail Ahmed Khan,Mohammed Al-Jumailey,Raheel Nawaz,Panos Liatsis	2020/09/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12923v3	ArXiv	Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019, studies have been addressing diverse aspects in relation to COVID-19 and Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC 202012/01) such as potential symptoms and predictive tools. However, limited work has been performed towards the modelling of complex associations between the combined demographic attributes and varying nature of the COVID-19 infections across the globe. This study presents an intelligent approach to investigate the multi-dimensional associations between demographic attributes and COVID-19 global variations. We gather multiple demographic attributes and COVID-19 infection data (by 8 January 2021) from reliable sources, which are then processed by intelligent algorithms to identify the significant associations and patterns within the data. Statistical results and experts' reports indicate strong associations between COVID-19 severity levels across the globe and certain demographic attributes, e.g. female smokers, when combined together with other attributes. The outcomes will aid the understanding of the dynamics of disease spread and its progression, which in turn may support policy makers, medical specialists and society, in better understanding and effective management of the disease.	1488
COVID-CT-MD: COVID-19 Computed Tomography (CT) Scan Dataset Applicable  in Machine Learning and Deep Learning	Parnian Afshar,Shahin Heidarian,Nastaran Enshaei,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Moezedin Javad Rafiee,Anastasia Oikonomou,Faranak Babaki Fard,Kaveh Samimi,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis,Arash Mohammadi	2020/09/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14623v1	ArXiv	Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has drastically overwhelmed more than 200 countries affecting millions and claiming almost 1 million lives, since its emergence in late 2019. This highly contagious disease can easily spread, and if not controlled in a timely fashion, can rapidly incapacitate healthcare systems. The current standard diagnosis method, the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT- PCR), is time consuming, and subject to low sensitivity. Chest Radiograph (CXR), the first imaging modality to be used, is readily available and gives immediate results. However, it has notoriously lower sensitivity than Computed Tomography (CT), which can be used efficiently to complement other diagnostic methods. This paper introduces a new COVID-19 CT scan dataset, referred to as COVID-CT-MD, consisting of not only COVID-19 cases, but also healthy and subjects infected by Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). COVID-CT-MD dataset, which is accompanied with lobe-level, slice-level and patient-level labels, has the potential to facilitate the COVID-19 research, in particular COVID-CT-MD can assist in development of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) based solutions.	1489
COVID19-HPSMP: COVID-19 Adopted Hybrid and Parallel Deep Information  Fusion Framework for Stock Price Movement Prediction	Farnoush Ronaghi,Mohammad Salimibeni,Farnoosh Naderkhani,Arash Mohammadi	2021/01/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02287v2	ArXiv	The novel of coronavirus (COVID-19) has suddenly and abruptly changed the world as we knew at the start of the 3rd decade of the 21st century. Particularly, COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected financial econometrics and stock markets across the globe. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial markets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement prediction (COVID19 PRIMO) dataset is introduced in this paper, which incorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market price movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is proposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures. Referred to as the COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep fusion framework for Stock price Movement Prediction (COVID19-HPSMP), innovative fusion strategies are used to combine scattered social media news related to COVID-19 with historical mark data. The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel paths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Local/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long Short term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a multilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion centre that combines localized features. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19 PRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework.	1490
Studying Leaders & Their Concerns Using Online Social Media During The  Times Of Crisis -- A COVID Case Study	Rahul Goel,Rajesh Sharma	2021/01/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03002v2	ArXiv	Online social media (OSM) has emerged as a prominent platform for debate on a wide range of issues. Even celebrities and public figures often share their opinions on a variety of topics through OSM platforms. One such subject that has gained a lot of coverage on Twitter is the Novel Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, which has become a pandemic and has sparked a crisis in human history. In this study, we examine 29 million tweets over three months to study highly influential users, whom we refer to as leaders. We recognize these leaders through social network techniques and analyze their tweets using text analysis. Using a community detection algorithm, we categorize these leaders into four clusters: research, news, health, and politics, with each cluster containing Twitter handles (accounts) of individual users or organizations. E.g., the health cluster includes the World Health Organization (@WHO), the Director-General of WHO (@DrTedros), and so on. The emotion analysis reveals that (i) all clusters show an equal amount of fear in their tweets, (ii) research and news clusters display more sadness than others, and (iii) health and politics clusters are attempting to win public trust. According to the text analysis, the (i) research cluster is more concerned with recognizing symptoms and the development of vaccination; (ii) news and politics clusters are mostly concerned with travel. We then show that we can use our findings to classify tweets into clusters with a score of 96% AUC ROC.	1491
Infections Forecasting and Intervention Effect Evaluation for COVID-19  via a Data-Driven Markov Process and Heterogeneous Simulation	Quan-Lin Li,Chengliang Wang,Yiming Xu,Chi Zhang,Yanxia Chang,Xiaole Wu,Zhen-Ping Fan,Zhi-Guo Liu	2021/01/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03133v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused tremendous amount of deaths and a devastating impact on the economic development all over the world. Thus, it is paramount to control its further transmission, for which purpose it is necessary to find the mechanism of its transmission process and evaluate the effect of different control strategies. To deal with these issues, we describe the transmission of COVID-19 as an explosive Markov process with four parameters. The state transitions of the proposed Markov process can clearly disclose the terrible explosion and complex heterogeneity of COVID-19. Based on this, we further propose a simulation approach with heterogeneous infections. Experimentations show that our approach can closely track the real transmission process of COVID-19, disclose its transmission mechanism, and forecast the transmission under different non-drug intervention strategies. More importantly, our approach can helpfully develop effective strategies for controlling COVID-19 and appropriately compare their control effect in different countries/cities.	1492
Impact of Interventional Policies Including Vaccine on Covid-19  Propagation and Socio-Economic Factors	Haonan Wu,Rajarshi Banerjee,Indhumathi Venkatachalam,Daniel Percy-Hughes,Praveen Chougale	2021/01/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03944v1	ArXiv	A novel coronavirus disease has emerged (later named COVID-19) and caused the world to enter a new reality, with many direct and indirect factors influencing it. Some are human-controllable (e.g. interventional policies, mobility and the vaccine); some are not (e.g. the weather). We have sought to test how a change in these human-controllable factors might influence two measures: the number of daily cases against economic impact. If applied at the right level and with up-to-date data to measure, policymakers would be able to make targeted interventions and measure their cost. This study aims to provide a predictive analytics framework to model, predict and simulate COVID-19 propagation and the socio-economic impact of interventions intended to reduce the spread of the disease such as policy and/or vaccine. It allows policymakers, government representatives and business leaders to make better-informed decisions about the potential effect of various interventions with forward-looking views via scenario planning. We have leveraged a recently launched open-source COVID-19 big data platform and used published research to find potentially relevant variables (features) and leveraged in-depth data quality checks and analytics for feature selection and predictions. An advanced machine learning pipeline has been developed armed with a self-evolving model, deployed on a modern machine learning architecture. It has high accuracy for trend prediction (back-tested with r-squared) and is augmented with interpretability for deeper insights.	1493
Leveraging Structured Biological Knowledge for Counterfactual Inference:  a Case Study of Viral Pathogenesis	Jeremy Zucker,Kaushal Paneri,Sara Mohammad-Taheri,Somya Bhargava,Pallavi Kolambkar,Craig Bakker,Jeremy Teuton,Charles Tapley Hoyt,Kristie Oxford,Robert Ness,Olga Vitek	2021/01/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05136v1	ArXiv	Counterfactual inference is a useful tool for comparing outcomes of interventions on complex systems. It requires us to represent the system in form of a structural causal model, complete with a causal diagram, probabilistic assumptions on exogenous variables, and functional assignments. Specifying such models can be extremely difficult in practice. The process requires substantial domain expertise, and does not scale easily to large systems, multiple systems, or novel system modifications. At the same time, many application domains, such as molecular biology, are rich in structured causal knowledge that is qualitative in nature. This manuscript proposes a general approach for querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and converting the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model that can learn from data to answer the question. We demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy and versatility of this approach using two case studies in systems biology. The first demonstrates the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the results. The second demonstrates the versatility of the approach by querying a knowledge base for the molecular determinants of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced cytokine storm, and performing counterfactual inference to estimate the causal effect of medical countermeasures for severely ill patients.	1494
Observational Study of Working from Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic  Using Social Media Data	Ziyu Xiong,Pin Li,Hanjia Lyu,Jiebo Luo	2021/01/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06762v3	ArXiv	Since March 2020, companies nationwide have started work from home (WFH) due to the rapid increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an attempt to help prevent the coronavirus from spreading and rescue the economy from the pandemic. Many organizations have conducted surveys to understand people's opinions towards WFH. However, the findings are limited due to small sample size and the dynamic topics over time. This study aims to understand the U.S. public opinions on working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conduct a large-scale social media study using Twitter data to portrait different groups who have positive/negative opinions about WFH. We perform an ordinary least squares regression to investigate the relationship between the sentiment about WFH and user characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, median household income, and population density. To better understand public opinion, we use latent Dirichlet allocation to extract topics and discover how tweet contents relate to people's attitudes. These findings provide evidence that sentiment about WFH varies across user characteristics. Furthermore, the content analysis sheds light on the nuanced differences in sentiment and reveals disparities relate to WFH.	1495
Twitter Subjective Well-Being Indicator During COVID-19 Pandemic: A  Cross-Country Comparative Study	Tiziana Carpi,Airo Hino,Stefano Maria Iacus,Giuseppe Porro	2021/01/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07695v1	ArXiv	This study analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the subjective well-being as measured through Twitter data indicators for Japan and Italy. It turns out that, overall, the subjective well-being dropped by 11.7% for Italy and 8.3% for Japan in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the last two months of 2019 and even more compared to the historical mean of the indexes. Through a data science approach we try to identify the possible causes of this drop down by considering several explanatory variables including, climate and air quality data, number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, Facebook Covid and flu symptoms global survey, Google Trends data and coronavirus-related searches, Google mobility data, policy intervention measures, economic variables and their Google Trends proxies, as well as health and stress proxy variables based on big data. We show that a simple static regression model is not able to capture the complexity of well-being and therefore we propose a dynamic elastic net approach to show how different group of factors may impact the well-being in different periods, even over a short time length, and showing further country-specific aspects. Finally, a structural equation modeling analysis tries to address the causal relationships among the COVID-19 factors and subjective well-being showing that, overall, prolonged mobility restrictions,flu and Covid-like symptoms, economic uncertainty, social distancing and news about the pandemic have negative effects on the subjective well-being.	1496
Classification of COVID-19 X-ray Images Using a Combination of Deep and  Handcrafted Features	Weihan Zhang,Bryan Pogorelsky,Mark Loveland,Trevor Wolf	2021/01/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07866v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrated the need for accurate and fast diagnosis methods for emergent viral diseases. Soon after the emergence of COVID-19, medical practitioners used X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of patients' lungs to detect COVID-19. Machine learning methods are capable of improving the identification accuracy of COVID-19 in X-ray and CT images, delivering near real-time results, while alleviating the burden on medical practitioners. In this work, we demonstrate the efficacy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, trained with a combination of deep convolutional and handcrafted features extracted from X-ray chest scans. We use this combination of features to discriminate between healthy, common pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients. The performance of the combined feature approach is compared with a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) and the SVM trained with handcrafted features. We find that combining the features in our novel framework improves the performance of the classification task compared to the independent application of convolutional and handcrafted features. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of 0.988 in the classification task with our combined approach compared to 0.963 and 0.983 accuracy for the handcrafted features with SVM and CNN respectively.	1497
A Social IoT-driven Pedestrian Routing Approach during Epidemic Time	Abdullah Khanfor,Hamdi Friji,Hakim Ghazzai,Yehia Massoud	2021/01/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09539v1	ArXiv	The unprecedented worldwide spread of coronavirus disease has significantly sped up the development of technology-based solutions to prevent, combat, monitor, or predict pandemics and/or its evolution. The omnipresence of smart Internet-of-things (IoT) devices can play a predominant role in designing advanced techniques helping in minimizing the risk of contamination. In this paper, we propose a practical framework that uses the Social IoT (SIoT) concept to improve pedestrians safely navigate through a real-wold map of a smart city. The objective is to mitigate the risks of exposure to the virus in high-dense areas where social distancing might not be well-practiced. The proposed routing approach recommends pedestrians' route in a real-time manner while considering other devices' mobility. First, the IoT devices are clustered into communities according to two SIoT relations that consider the devices' locations and the friendship levels among their owners. Accordingly, the city map roads are assigned weights representing their safety levels. Afterward, a navigation algorithm, namely the Dijkstra algorithm, is applied to recommend the safest route to follow. Simulation results applied on a real-world IoT data set have shown the ability of the proposed approach in achieving trade-offs between both safest and shortest paths according to the pedestrian preference.	1498
A multi-objective time series analysis of community mobility reduction  comparing first and second COVID-19 waves	Gabriela Cavalcante da Silva,Fernanda Monteiro de Almeida,Sabrina Oliveira,Leonardo C. T. Bezerra,Elizabeth F. Wanner,Ricardo H. C. Takahashi	2021/02/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00535v1	ArXiv	With the logistic challenges faced by most countries for the production, distribution, and application of vaccines for the novel coronavirus disease~(COVID-19), social distancing~(SD) remains the most tangible approach to mitigate the spread of the virus. To assist SD monitoring, several tech companies have made publicly available anonymized mobility data. In this work, we conduct a multi-objective mobility reduction rate comparison between the first and second COVID-19 waves in several localities from America and Europe using Google community mobility reports~(CMR) data. Through multi-dimensional visualization, we are able to compare in a Pareto-compliant way the reduction in mobility from the different lockdown periods for each locality selected, simultaneously considering all place categories provided in CMR. In addition, our analysis comprises a 56-day lockdown period for each locality and COVID-19 wave, which we analyze both as 56-day periods and as 14-day consecutive windows. Results vary considerably as a function of the locality considered, particularly when the temporal evolution of the mobility reduction is considered. We thus discuss each locality individually, relating social distancing measures and the reduction observed.	1499
COVID-19 vaccination strategies on dynamic networks	Quoc Huy Nguyen,Jessica Liebig,Md Shahzamal,Bernard Mans,Raja Jurdak	2021/03/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01957v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a global public health concern. A great proportion of the world needs to be vaccinated in order to stop the rapid spread of the disease. In addition to prioritising vulnerable sections of the population to receive the vaccine, an ideal degree-based vaccination strategy uses fine-grained contact networks to prioritise vaccine recipients. This strategy is costly and impractical due to the enormous amount of specific contact information needed. It also does not capture indirect famine or aerosol-based transmission. We recently proposed a new vaccination strategy called Individual's Movement-based Vaccination (IMV), which takes into account both direct and indirect transmission and is based on the types of places people visit. IMV was shown to be cost-efficient in the case of influenza-like diseases. This paper studies the application of IMV to COVID-19 using its documented transmission parameters. We conduct large scale computer simulations based on a city-wide empirical mobility dataset to evaluate the performance and practicability of the strategy. Results show that the proposed strategy achieves nearly five times the efficiency of random vaccination and performs comparably to the degree-based strategy, while significantly reducing the data collection requirements.	1500
A Two-Sample Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization Method Accounting  for Linkage Disequilibrium and Idiosyncratic Pleiotropy with Applications to  the COVID-19 Outcome	Anqi Wang,Zhonghua Liu	2021/03/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02877v3	ArXiv	Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical method exploiting genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of modifiable risk factors on an outcome of interest. Despite wide uses of various popular two-sample MR methods based on genome-wide association study summary level data, however, those methods could suffer from potential power loss or/and biased inference when the chosen genetic variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD), and also have relatively large direct effects on the outcome whose distribution might be heavy-tailed which is commonly referred to as the idiosyncratic pleiotropy phenomenon. To resolve those two issues, we propose a novel Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization (RBMR) model that uses the more robust multivariate generalized t-distribution to model such direct effects in a probabilistic model framework which can also incorporate the LD structure explicitly. The generalized t-distribution can be represented as a Gaussian scaled mixture so that our model parameters can be estimated by the EM-type algorithms. We compute the standard errors by calibrating the evidence lower bound using the likelihood ratio test. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our RBMR has robust performance compared to other competing methods. We also apply our RBMR method to two benchmark data sets and find that RBMR has smaller bias and standard errors. Using our proposed RBMR method, we find that coronary artery disease is associated with increased risk of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We also develop a user-friendly R package RBMR for public use.	1501
Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning with a Saliency-aware  Projection for COVID-19 Lung Infections Segmentation	Huimin Huang,Ming Cai,Lanfen Lin,Jing Zheng,Xiongwei Mao,Xiaohan Qian,Zhiyi Peng,Jianying Zhou,Yutaro Iwamoto,Xian-Hua Han,Yen-Wei Chen,Ruofeng Tong	2021/03/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04235v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread in 2020, emerging a mass of studies for lung infection segmentation from CT images. Though many methods have been proposed for this issue, it is a challenging task because of infections of various size appearing in different lobe zones. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR) module, which is capable of modeling long-range dependencies among disjoint infections as well as adapt size variation. We first incorporate graph convolution to exploit long-term contextual information from multiple lobe zones. Different from previous average pooling or maximum object probability, we propose a saliency-aware projection mechanism to pick up infection-related pixels as a set of graph nodes. After graph reasoning, the relation-aware features are reversed back to the original coordinate space for the down-stream tasks. We further construct multiple graphs with different sampling rates to handle the size variation problem. To this end, distinct multi-scale long-range contextual patterns can be captured. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any architecture to improve its performance. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method consistently boost the performance of state-of-the-art backbone architectures on both of public and our private COVID-19 datasets.	1502
Bio-JOIE: Joint Representation Learning of Biological Knowledge Bases	Junheng Hao,Chelsea Ju,Muhao Chen,Yizhou Sun,Carlo Zaniolo,Wei Wang	2021/03/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04283v1	ArXiv	The widespread of Coronavirus has led to a worldwide pandemic with a high mortality rate. Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease.	1503
Semi-supervised Learning for COVID-19 Image Classification via ResNet	Lucy Nwosu,Xiangfang Li,Lijun Qian,Seungchan Kim,Xishuang Dong	2021/02/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06140v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic in over 200 countries and territories, which has resulted in a great public health concern across the international community. Analysis of X-ray imaging data can play a critical role in timely and accurate screening and fighting against COVID-19. Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied to recognize COVID-19 pathology from X-ray imaging datasets. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated X-ray images to train models, which is often not applicable to data analysis for emerging events such as COVID-19 outbreak, especially in the early stage of the outbreak. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-path semi-supervised deep learning model, ssResNet, based on Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for COVID-19 image classification, where two paths refer to a supervised path and an unsupervised path, respectively. Moreover, we design a weighted supervised loss that assigns higher weight for the minority classes in the training process to resolve the data imbalance. Experimental results on a large-scale of X-ray image dataset COVIDx demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve promising performance even when trained on very few labeled training images.	1504
Numerical simulation of pulmonary airway reopening by the EOS-based  multiphase lattice Boltzmann method	Bing He,Chunyan Qin,Wenbo Chen,Binghai Wen	2021/03/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08301v1	ArXiv	The aerosol formation is associated with the rupture of the liquid plug during the pulmonary airway reopening. The fluid dynamics of this process is difficult to predict because the rupture involved complex liquid-gas transition. Equation of state (EOS) plays a key role in the thermodynamic process of liquid-gas transition. Here, we propose an EOS-based multiphase lattice Boltzmann model, in which the nonideal force is directly evaluated by EOSs. This multiphase model is used to model the pulmonary airway reopening and study aerosol formation during exhalation. The numerical model is first validated with the simulations of Fujioka et al.(2008). and the result is in reasonable agreement with their study. Furthermore, two rupture cases with and without aerosol formation are contrasted and analyzed. It is found that the injury on the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation is essentially the same that of without aerosol formation even while the pressure drop in airway increases by about 67%. Then extensive simulations are performed to investigate the effects of pressure drop, thickness of liquid plug and film on aerosol size and the mechanical stresses. The results show that aerosol size and the mechanical stresses increase as the pressure drop enlarges and thickness of liquid plug become thicken, while aerosol size and the mechanical stresses decrease as thickness of liquid film is thicken. The present multiphase model can be extended to study the generation and transmission of bioaerosols which can carry the bioparticles of influenza or coronavirus.	1505
Superspreading k-cores at the center of COVID-19 pandemic persistence	Matteo Serafino,Higor S. Monteiro,Shaojun Luo,Saulo D. S. Reis,Carles Igual,Antonio S. Lima Neto,Matias Travizano,José S. Andrade, Jr.,Hernán A. Makse	2021/03/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08685v1	ArXiv	The spread of COVID-19 caused by the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a worldwide problem with devastating consequences. To slow down the spread of the pandemic, mass quarantines have been implemented globally, provoking further social and economic disruptions. Here, we implement a comprehensive contact tracing network analysis to find an optimized quarantine protocol to dismantle the chain of transmission of coronavirus with minimal disruptions to society. We track billions of anonymized GPS human mobility datapoints from a compilation of hundreds of mobile apps deployed in Latin America to monitor the evolution of the contact network of disease transmission before and after the confinements. As a consequence of the lockdowns, people's mobility across the region decreases by $\sim$53\%, which results in a drastic disintegration of the transmission network by $\sim$90\%. However, this disintegration did not halt the spreading of the disease. Our analysis indicates that superspreading k-core structures persist in the transmission network to prolong the pandemic. Once the k-cores are identified, an optimized strategy to break the chain of transmission is to quarantine a minimal number of 'weak links' with high betweenness centrality connecting the large k-cores. As countries built contact tracing apps to fight the pandemic, our results could turn into a valuable resource to help deploy quarantine protocols with minimized disruptions.	1506
Unconstrained Face-Mask & Face-Hand Datasets: Building a Computer Vision  System to Help Prevent the Transmission of COVID-19	Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel	2021/03/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08773v3	ArXiv	Health organizations advise social distancing, wearing face mask, and avoiding touching face to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Based on these protective measures, we developed a computer vision system to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, the developed system performs face mask detection, face-hand interaction detection, and measures social distance. To train and evaluate the developed system, we collected and annotated images that represent face mask usage and face-hand interaction in the real world. Besides assessing the performance of the developed system on our own datasets, we also tested it on existing datasets in the literature without performing any adaptation on them. In addition, we proposed a module to track social distance between people. Experimental results indicate that our datasets represent the real-world's diversity well. The proposed system achieved very high performance and generalization capacity for face mask usage detection, face-hand interaction detection, and measuring social distance in a real-world scenario on unseen data. The datasets will be available at https://github.com/iremeyiokur/COVID-19-Preventions-Control-System.	1507
A novel approach to understanding CoViD-19: exploring the interplay of  SARS-CoV-2 and CTL response	João Paulo Simões Maurício de Carvalho	2021/03/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09053v5	ArXiv	Facing a global challenge with over 6.9 million fatalities, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of CoViD-19, demands novel and comprehensive approaches to understand its complex dynamics. This paper introduces a non-integer order model, capturing the intricate interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host's cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) response. Our work reveals a unique parameter space, in which an endemic state of SARS-CoV-2 and a CTL response-free equilibrium can coexist -- a crucial finding in our quest to decipher this pervasive virus. We further explore the basic reproduction number, assessing how different model parameters can potentially inhibit or fuel the infection's progression. Through extensive numerical simulations, we scrutinize the impact of varying the order of the fractional derivative and employing diverse CTL proliferation functions. This study significantly enriches our understanding of CoViD-19 immunopathology, offering invaluable insights that could guide future research and therapeutic strategies.	1508
Detection of fake news on CoViD-19 on Web Search Engines	V. Mazzeo,A. Rapisarda,G. Giuffrida	2021/03/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11804v2	ArXiv	In early January 2020, after China reported the first cases of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the city of Wuhan, unreliable and not fully accurate information has started spreading faster than the virus itself. Alongside this pandemic, people have experienced a parallel infodemic, i.e., an overabundance of information, some of which misleading or even harmful, that has widely spread around the globe. Although Social Media are increasingly being used as information source, Web Search Engines, like Google or Yahoo!, still represent a powerful and trustworthy resource for finding information on the Web. This is due to their capability to capture the largest amount of information, helping users quickly identify the most relevant, useful, although not always the most reliable, results for their search queries. This study aims to detect potential misleading and fake contents by capturing and analysing textual information, which flow through Search Engines. By using a real-world dataset associated with recent CoViD-19 pandemic, we first apply re-sampling techniques for class imbalance, then we use existing Machine Learning algorithms for classification of not reliable news. By extracting lexical and host-based features of associated Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for news articles, we show that the proposed methods, so common in phishing and malicious URLs detection, can improve the efficiency and performance of classifiers. Based on these findings, we suggest that the use of both textual and URLs features can improve the effectiveness of fake news detection methods.	1509
Remote Sensing to Control Respiratory Viral Diseases Outbreaks using  Internet of Vehicles	Yesin Sahraoui,Ahmed Korichi,Chaker Abdelaziz Kerrache,Muhammad Bilal,Marica Amadeo	2020/08/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12512v1	ArXiv	"The respiratory viral diseases, such as those caused by the family of coronaviruses, can be extremely contagious and spread through saliva droplets generated by coughing, sneezing, or breathing. In humans, the most common symptoms of the infection include fever and difficulty in breathing. In order to reduce the diffusion of the current ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"" pandemic, the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can play an important role; for instance, they can be effectively used for implementing a real-time patient tracking and warning system at a city scale. Crucial places to install the tracking IoT devices are the public/private vehicles that, augmented with multiple connectivity solutions, can implement the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm. In such a ubiquitous network environment, vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors, including regular cameras that can be replaced with thermal cameras. Therefore, this paper proposes a new design for widely detecting respiratory viral diseases that leverages IoV to collect real-time body temperature and breathing rate measurements of pedestrians. This information can be used to recognize geographic areas affected by possible COVID-19 cases and to implement proactive preventive strategies that would further limit the spread of the disease."	1510
An Exploration of Geo-temporal Characteristics of Users' Reactions on  Social Media During the Pandemic	Eldor Abdukhamidov,Firuz Juraev,Mohammed Abuhamad,Tamer AbuHmed	2021/03/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13032v1	ArXiv	During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, social networks become the preeminent medium for communication, social discussion, and entertainment. Social network users are regularly expressing their opinions about the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, social networks serve as a reliable source for studying the topics, emotions, and attitudes of users that are discussed during the pandemic. In this paper, we investigate the reactions and attitudes of people towards topics raised on social media platforms. We collected data of two large-scale COVID-19 datasets from Twitter and Instagram for six and three months, respectively. The paper analyzes the reaction of social network users on different aspects including sentiment analysis, topics detection, emotions, and geo-temporal characteristics of our dataset. We show that the dominant sentiment reactions on social media are neutral while the most discussed topics by social network users are about health issues. The paper examines the countries that attracted more posts and reactions from people, as well as the distribution of health-related topics discussed in the most mentioned countries. We shed light on the temporal shift of topics over countries. Our results show that posts from the top-mentioned countries influence and attract more reaction worldwide than posts from other parts of the world.	1511
YouTubing at Home: Media Sharing Behavior Change as Proxy for  MobilityAround COVID-19 Lockdowns	Yelena Mejova,Nicolas Kourtellis	2021/03/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14601v1	ArXiv	Compliance with public health measures, such as restrictions on movement and socialization, is paramount in limiting the spread of diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (also referred to as COVID-19). Although large population datasets, such as phone-based mobility data, may provide some glimpse into such compliance, it is often proprietary, and may not be available for all locales. In this work, we examine the usefulness of video sharing on social media as a proxy of the amount of time Internet users spend at home. In particular, we focus on the number of people sharing YouTube videos on Twitter before and during COVID-19 lockdown measures were imposed by 109 countries. We find that the media sharing behavior differs widely between countries, in some having immediate response to the lockdown decrees - mostly by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a substantial lag. We confirm that these insights correlate strongly with mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations. We make the media sharing volume data available to the research community for continued monitoring of behavior change around public health measures.	1512

COVID-19 epidemic control using short-term lockdowns for collective gain	Mauro Bisiacco,Gianluigi Pillonetto	2021/09/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00995v1	ArXiv	While many efforts are currently devoted to vaccines development and administration, social distancing measures, including severe restrictions such as lockdowns, remain fundamental tools to contain the spread of COVID-19. A crucial point for any government is to understand, on the basis of the epidemic curve, the right temporal instant to set up a lockdown and then to remove it. Different strategies are being adopted with distinct shades of intensity. USA and Europe tend to introduce restrictions of considerable temporal length. They vary in time: a severe lockdown may be reached and then gradually relaxed. An interesting alternative is the Australian model where short and sharp responses have repeatedly tackled the virus and allowed people a return to near normalcy. After a few positive cases are detected, a lockdown is immediately set. In this paper we show that the Australian model can be generalized and given a rigorous mathematical analysis, casting strategies of the type short-term pain for collective gain in the context of sliding-mode control, an important branch of nonlinear control theory. This allows us to gain important insights regarding how to implement short-term lockdowns, obtaining a better understanding of their merits and possible limitations. Our model predicts the duration of the severe lockdown to be set to maintain e.g. the number of people in intensive care under a certain threshold. After tuning our strategy exploiting data collected in Italy, it turns out that COVID-19 epidemic could be e.g. controlled by alternating one or two weeks of complete lockdown with one or two months of freedom, respectively. Control strategies of this kind, where the lockdown's duration is well circumscribed, could be important also to alleviate coronavirus impact on economy.	1515
A Dynamic Topic Identification and Labeling Approach of COVID-19 Tweets	Khandaker Tayef Shahriar,Iqbal H. Sarker,Muhammad Nazrul Islam,Mohammad Ali Moni	2021/08/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02462v1	ArXiv	This paper formulates the problem of dynamically identifying key topics with proper labels from COVID-19 Tweets to provide an overview of wider public opinion. Nowadays, social media is one of the best ways to connect people through Internet technology, which is also considered an essential part of our daily lives. In late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was reported, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency due to its rapid spread all over the world. The COVID-19 epidemic has affected the use of social media by many people across the globe. Twitter is one of the most influential social media services, which has seen a dramatic increase in its use from the epidemic. Thus dynamic extraction of specific topics with labels from tweets of COVID-19 is a challenging issue for highlighting conversation instead of manual topic labeling approach. In this paper, we propose a framework that automatically identifies the key topics with labels from the tweets using the top Unigram feature of aspect terms cluster from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) generated topics. Our experiment result shows that this dynamic topic identification and labeling approach is effective having the accuracy of 85.48\% with respect to the manual static approach.	1516
Cross-Site Severity Assessment of COVID-19 from CT Images via Domain  Adaptation	Geng-Xin Xu,Chen Liu,Jun Liu,Zhongxiang Ding,Feng Shi,Man Guo,Wei Zhao,Xiaoming Li,Ying Wei,Yaozong Gao,Chuan-Xian Ren,Dinggang Shen	2021/09/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03478v1	ArXiv	Early and accurate severity assessment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images offers a great help to the estimation of intensive care unit event and the clinical decision of treatment planning. To augment the labeled data and improve the generalization ability of the classification model, it is necessary to aggregate data from multiple sites. This task faces several challenges including class imbalance between mild and severe infections, domain distribution discrepancy between sites, and presence of heterogeneous features. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation (DA) method with two components to address these problems. The first component is a stochastic class-balanced boosting sampling strategy that overcomes the imbalanced learning problem and improves the classification performance on poorly-predicted classes. The second component is a representation learning that guarantees three properties: 1) domain-transferability by prototype triplet loss, 2) discriminant by conditional maximum mean discrepancy loss, and 3) completeness by multi-view reconstruction loss. Particularly, we propose a domain translator and align the heterogeneous data to the estimated class prototypes (i.e., class centers) in a hyper-sphere manifold. Experiments on cross-site severity assessment of COVID-19 from CT images show that the proposed method can effectively tackle the imbalanced learning problem and outperform recent DA approaches.	1517
Behavioral Bias Benefits: Beating Benchmarks By Bundling Bouncy Baskets	Ravi Kashyap	2021/08/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03740v1	ArXiv	"We consider in detail an investment strategy, titled ""The Bounce Basket"", designed for someone to express a bullish view on the market by allowing them to take long positions on securities that would benefit the most from a rally in the markets. We demonstrate the use of quantitative metrics and large amounts of historical data towards decision making goals. This investment concept combines macroeconomic views with characteristics of individual securities to beat the market returns. The central idea of this theme is to identity securities from a regional perspective that are heavily shorted and yet are fundamentally sound with at least a minimum buy rating from a consensus of stock analysts covering the securities. We discuss the components of creating such a strategy including the mechanics of constructing the portfolio. Using simulations, in which securities lending data is modeled as geometric brownian motions, we provide a few flavors of creating a ranking of securities to identity the ones that are heavily shorted.   An investment strategy of this kind will be ideal in market scenarios when a downturn happens due to unexpected extreme events and the markets are anticipated to bounce back thereafter. This situation is especially applicable to incidents being observed, and relevant proceedings, during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020-2021. This strategy is one particular way to overcome a potential behavioral bias related to investing, which we term the ""rebound effect""."	1518
ASGARD: A Single-cell Guided pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs	Bing He,Yao Xiao,Haodong Liang,Qianhui Huang,Yuheng Du,Yijun Li,David Garmire,Duxin Sun,Lana X. Garmire	2021/09/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06377v4	ArXiv	Intercellular heterogeneity is a major obstacle to successful precision medicine. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled in-depth analysis of intercellular heterogeneity in various diseases. However, its full potential for precision medicine has yet to be reached. Towards this, we propose a new drug recommendation system called: A Single-cell Guided Pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs (ASGARD). ASGARD defines a novel drug score predicting drugs by considering all cell clusters to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. We tested ASGARD on multiple diseases, including breast cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On single-drug therapy, ASGARD shows significantly better average accuracy (AUC of 0.92) compared to two other bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods (AUC of 0.80 and 0.76). It is also considerably better (AUC of 0.82) than other cell cluster level predicting methods (AUC of 0.67 and 0.55). In addition, ASGARD is also validated by the drug response prediction method TRANSACT with Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer patient samples. Many top-ranked drugs are either approved by FDA or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. In silico cell-type specific drop-out experiments using triple-negative breast cancers show the importance of T cells in the tumor microenvironment in affecting drug predictions. In conclusion, ASGARD is a promising drug repurposing recommendation tool guided by single-cell RNA-seq for personalized medicine. ASGARD is free for educational use at https://github.com/lanagarmire/ASGARD.	1519
Los fact-checkers iberoamericanos frente a la COVID-19. Análisis de  actividad en Facebook / The Ibero-American fact-checkers facing the COVID-19.  Analysis of activity on Facebook	Alberto Dafonte-Gómez,María-Isabel Míguez-González,Xabier Martínez-Rolán	2021/09/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06533v1	ArXiv	Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic revealed infodemics as an aggravating factor in health emergencies, a situation that enhanced the role of data verification journalism in crisis situations. This article aims to know the dynamics of publication and interaction on Facebook of the international fact-checking group LatamChequea Coronavirus during the first two months after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by the WHO (March 11, 2020 - May 11, 2020). Methodology: The contents, metadata and reactions generated in a total of 5736 posts published by 31 different fact-checkers were collected with Crowdtangle and analyzed. Results: Among the most shared publications, those related to the COVID-19 generated more reactions and comments than those referring to other topics; the volume of shares is high in relation to other generally more frequent interactions and publications that include links achieved more interactions of all kinds than those based on videos or images. There are positive correlations between the number of likes and the number of shares, and between the angry reaction and the number of comments. Discussion and conclusions: The relevance of sharing in the set of interactions would indicate a high interest of the users to share the denials about fake news, something that distances from previous referenced investigations. The results also point to the influence of the emotional reaction expressed in the interaction with the content in the form of sharing or commenting.	1520
Influence of Mobility Restrictions on Transmission of COVID-19 in the  state of Maryland -- the USA	Nandini Raghuraman,Kartik Kaushik	2021/09/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12219v2	ArXiv	Background: The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in the United States in January 2020. To curb the spread of the disease in mid-March, different states issued mandatory stay-at-home (SAH) orders. These nonpharmaceutical interventions were mandated based on prior experiences, such as the 1918 influenza epidemic. Hence, we decided to study the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We designed an ecological time series study with our exposure variable as Mobility patterns in the state of Maryland for March- December 2020 and our outcome variable as the COVID-19 hospitalizations for the same period. We built an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble machine learning model and regressed the lagged COVID-19 hospitalizations with Mobility volume for different regions of Maryland. Results: We found an 18% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations when mobility was increased by a factor of five, similarly a 43% increase when mobility was further increased by a factor of ten. Conclusion: The findings of our study demonstrated a positive linear relationship between mobility and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. These findings are partially consistent with other studies suggesting the benefits of mobility restrictions. Although more detailed approach is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.	1521
Implementation of a practical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling  algorithm in PyBioNetFit	Jacob Neumann,Yen Ting Lin,Abhishek Mallela,Ely F. Miller,Joshua Colvin,Abell T. Duprat1,Ye Chen,William S. Hlavacek,Richard G. Posner	2021/09/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14445v1	ArXiv	Bayesian inference in biological modeling commonly relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of a multidimensional and non-Gaussian posterior distribution that is not analytically tractable. Here, we present the implementation of a practical MCMC method in the open-source software package PyBioNetFit (PyBNF), which is designed to support parameterization of mathematical models for biological systems. The new MCMC method, am, incorporates an adaptive move proposal distribution. For warm starts, sampling can be initiated at a specified location in parameter space and with a multivariate Gaussian proposal distribution defined initially by a specified covariance matrix. Multiple chains can be generated in parallel using a computer cluster. We demonstrate that am can be used to successfully solve real-world Bayesian inference problems, including forecasting of new Coronavirus Disease 2019 case detection with Bayesian quantification of forecast uncertainty. PyBNF version 1.1.9, the first stable release with am, is available at PyPI and can be installed using the pip package-management system on platforms that have a working installation of Python 3. PyBNF relies on libRoadRunner and BioNetGen for simulations (e.g., numerical integration of ordinary differential equations defined in SBML or BNGL files) and Dask.Distributed for task scheduling on Linux computer clusters.	1522
A Machine Learning Analysis of COVID-19 Mental Health Data	Mostafa Rezapour,Lucas Hansen	2021/12/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00227v2	ArXiv	In late December 2019, the novel coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2) and the resulting disease COVID-19 were first identified in Wuhan China. The disease slipped through containment measures, with the first known case in the United States being identified on January 20th, 2020. In this paper, we utilize survey data from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research and apply several statistical and machine learning models and techniques such as Decision Trees, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Random Forests, Gradient Tree Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Synthetic Minority Oversampling, and Chi-Squared Test to analyze the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the mental health of frontline workers in the United States. Through the interpretation of the many models applied to the mental health survey data, we have concluded that the most important factor in predicting the mental health decline of a frontline worker is the healthcare role the individual is in (Nurse, Emergency Room Staff, Surgeon, etc.), followed by the amount of sleep the individual has had in the last week, the amount of COVID-19 related news an individual has consumed on average in a day, the age of the worker, and the usage of alcohol and cannabis.	1523
Heuristic Hyperparameter Optimization for Convolutional Neural Networks  using Genetic Algorithm	Meng Zhou	2021/12/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07087v1	ArXiv	In recent years, people from all over the world are suffering from one of the most severe diseases in history, known as Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19 for short. When the virus reaches the lungs, it has a higher probability to cause lung pneumonia and sepsis. X-ray image is a powerful tool in identifying the typical features of the infection for COVID-19 patients. The radiologists and pathologists observe that ground-glass opacity appears in the chest X-ray for infected patient \cite{cozzi2021ground}, and it could be used as one of the criteria during the diagnosis process. In the past few years, deep learning has proven to be one of the most powerful methods in the field of image classification. Due to significant differences in Chest X-Ray between normal and infected people \cite{rousan2020chest}, deep models could be used to identify the presence of the disease given a patient's Chest X-Ray. Many deep models are complex, and it evolves with lots of input parameters. Designers sometimes struggle with the tuning process for deep models, especially when they build up the model from scratch. Genetic Algorithm, inspired by the biological evolution process, plays a key role in solving such complex problems. In this paper, I proposed a genetic-based approach to optimize the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for the Chest X-Ray classification task.	1524
Fusing Low-Latency Data Feeds with Death Data to Accurately Nowcast  COVID-19 Related Deaths	Conor Rosato,Robert E. Moore,Matthew Carter,John Heap,Jose Storopoli,Simon Maskell	2021/12/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08097v1	ArXiv	The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has generated a need to quickly and accurately assemble up-to-date information related to its spread. While it is possible to use deaths to provide a reliable information feed, the latency of data derived from deaths is significant. Confirmed cases derived from positive test results potentially provide a lower latency data feed. However, the sampling of those tested varies with time and the reason for testing is often not recorded. Hospital admissions typically occur around 1-2 weeks after infection and can be considered out of date in relation to the time of initial infection. The extent to which these issues are problematic is likely to vary over time and between countries.   We use a machine learning algorithm for natural language processing, trained in multiple languages, to identify symptomatic individuals derived from social media and, in particular Twitter, in real-time. We then use an extended SEIRD epidemiological model to fuse combinations of low-latency feeds, including the symptomatic counts from Twitter, with death data to estimate parameters of the model and nowcast the number of people in each compartment. The model is implemented in the probabilistic programming language Stan and uses a bespoke numerical integrator. We present results showing that using specific low-latency data feeds along with death data provides more consistent and accurate forecasts of COVID-19 related deaths than using death data alone.	1525
Intersection and Union Hierarchies of Deterministic Context-Free  Languages and Pumping Lemmas	Tomoyuki Yamakami	2021/12/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09383v1	ArXiv	We study the computational complexity of finite intersections and unions of deterministic context-free (dcf) languages. Earlier, Wotschke [J. Comput. System Sci. 16 (1978) 456--461] demonstrated that intersections of $(d+1)$ dcf languages are in general more powerful than intersections of $d$ dcf languages for any positive integer $d$ based on the intersection hierarchy separation of Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185--192]. The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke's result is not directly extendable to disprove any given language to be written in the form of $d$ intersection of dcf languages. To deal with the non-membership of a wide range of languages, we circumvent the specialization of their proof argument and devise a new and practical technical tool: two pumping lemmas for finite unions of dcf languages. Since the family of dcf languages is closed under complementation and also under intersection with regular languages, these pumping lemmas help us establish a non-membership relation of languages formed by finite intersections of non-bounded languages as well. We also refer to a relationship to deterministic limited automata of Hibbard [Inf. Control 11 (1967) 196--238] in this regard.	1526
Hybrid Learning Aided Technology-Rich Instructional Tools -- A Case  Study: Community College of Qatar	Muhammad Jamal Shehab,Mosa Alokla,Mais Alkhateeb,Mohammad Alokla	2021/12/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11197v1	ArXiv	Educational Institutions have an essential role in promoting the teaching and learning process, within universities, colleges, and communities. Due to the recent coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic, many educational institutions adopted hybrid learning (HL), which is a combination of classic and online learning. It integrates the advantages of both, and it is a fundamental factor to ensure continued learning. Technological innovations such as HL are changing the teaching process, and how students, lecturers, and administrators interact. Based on this, the Community College of Qatar (CCQ) focused on researching the structures and elements related to the adoption of HL. Thus, the goal of this research paper is to reveal the impact of HL on the learning process in CCQ, and the effective instructional technology (INST) tools required for a successful HL program. Our research questions for the survey were designed to measure the opinions of the students, instructors, and administrators about the HL program. It is observed from the results that the majority of students, instructors, and administrators showed a positive attitude toward HL, but some had negative views and experienced challenges. The results were analyzed and discussed to better utilize HL to meet the growing demands of the community.	1527
Machine learning approaches for localized lockdown during COVID-19: a  case study analysis	Sara Malvar,Julio Romano Meneghini	2022/01/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00715v1	ArXiv	At the end of 2019, the latest novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 emerged as a significant acute respiratory disease that has become a global pandemic. Countries like Brazil have had difficulty in dealing with the virus due to the high socioeconomic difference of states and municipalities. Therefore, this study presents a new approach using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms applied to Brazilian COVID-19 data. First, a clustering algorithm is used to identify counties with similar sociodemographic behavior, while Benford's law is used to check for data manipulation. Based on these results we are able to correctly model SARIMA models based on the clusters to predict new daily cases. The unsupervised machine learning techniques optimized the process of defining the parameters of the SARIMA model. This framework can also be useful to propose confinement scenarios during the so-called second wave. We have used the 645 counties from S\~ao Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil. However, this methodology can be used in other states or countries. This paper demonstrates how different techniques of machine learning, deep learning, data mining and statistics can be used together to produce important results when dealing with pandemic data. Although the findings cannot be used exclusively to assess and influence policy decisions, they offer an alternative to the ineffective measures that have been used.	1528
Highly coordinated nationwide massive travel restrictions are central to  effective mitigation and control of COVID-19 outbreaks in China	Xingru Chen,Feng Fu	2022/01/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02353v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused graving woes across the globe since first reported in the epicenter Wuhan, Hubei, China, December 2019. The spread of COVID-19 in China has been successfully curtailed by massive travel restrictions that put more than 900 million people housebound for more than two months since the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January 2020 when other provinces in China followed suit. Here, we assess the impact of China's massive lockdowns and travel restrictions reflected by the changes in mobility patterns before and during the lockdown period. We quantify the synchrony of mobility patterns across provinces and within provinces. Using these mobility data, we calibrate movement flow between provinces in combination with an epidemiological compartment model to quantify the effectiveness of lockdowns and reductions in disease transmission. Our analysis demonstrates that the onset and phase of local community transmission in other provinces depends on the cumulative population outflow received from the epicenter Hubei. As such, infections can propagate further into other interconnected places both near and far, thereby necessitating synchronous lockdowns. Moreover, our data-driven modeling analysis shows that lockdowns and consequently reduced mobility lag a certain time to elicit an actual impact on slowing down the spreading and ultimately putting the epidemic under check. In spite of the vastly heterogeneous demographics and epidemiological characteristics across China, mobility data shows that massive travel restrictions have been applied consistently via a top-down approach along with high levels of compliance from the bottom up.	1529
Lung infection and normal region segmentation from CT volumes of  COVID-19 cases	Masahiro Oda,Yuichiro Hayashi,Yoshito Otake,Masahiro Hashimoto,Toshiaki Akashi,Kensaku Mori	2022/01/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03050v1	ArXiv	This paper proposes an automated segmentation method of infection and normal regions in the lung from CT volumes of COVID-19 patients. From December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads over the world and giving significant impacts to our economic activities and daily lives. To diagnose the large number of infected patients, diagnosis assistance by computers is needed. Chest CT is effective for diagnosis of viral pneumonia including COVID-19. A quantitative analysis method of condition of the lung from CT volumes by computers is required for diagnosis assistance of COVID-19. This paper proposes an automated segmentation method of infection and normal regions in the lung from CT volumes using a COVID-19 segmentation fully convolutional network (FCN). In diagnosis of lung diseases including COVID-19, analysis of conditions of normal and infection regions in the lung is important. Our method recognizes and segments lung normal and infection regions in CT volumes. To segment infection regions that have various shapes and sizes, we introduced dense pooling connections and dilated convolutions in our FCN. We applied the proposed method to CT volumes of COVID-19 cases. From mild to severe cases of COVID-19, the proposed method correctly segmented normal and infection regions in the lung. Dice scores of normal and infection regions were 0.911 and 0.753, respectively.	1530
Comparison of Classification Algorithms for COVID19 Detection using  Cough Acoustic Signals	Yunus Emre Erdoğan,Ali Narin	2022/01/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04872v1	ArXiv	The epidemic disease, called the new coronavirus (COVID19), firstly occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID19 was announced as an epidemic by World Health Organization soon after. Some of the symptoms of this disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing. In more severe cases, death may occur as a result of infection. The most significant question in fighting the pandemic and controlling the epidemic is the early diagnosis of COVID19(+) patients and the follow-up of these patients. Therefore, various diagnostic mechanisms are used. Additionally to the RT-PCR test, medical imaging methods have been utilized, especially in the detection of COVID19(+) patients. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed by using cough data, which is one of the most prominent symptoms of COVID19(+) patients. The cough acoustic public dataset on the Virufy website was used. The entire data was normalized using z-normalization technique. The performance of the features obtained via the 5-layer empirical mode decomposition method and the performances of different classifiers has been compared. As the classifier algorithm, 5 different algorithms were used. The highest accuracy and F1-score performances were obtained by using Ensemble-Bagged-Trees algorithm as 90.6% and 90.5%, respectively. On the other hand, other classification algorithms used in the study are Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and k-Nearest Neigbors, respectively. According to the results obtained, choosing the right classifier algorithm provides high results. Thus, it is clear that using cough acoustic data, those with COVID19(+) can be detected easily and effectively.	1531
Comparison of COVID-19 Prediction Performances of Normalization Methods  on Cough Acoustics Sounds	Yunus Emre Erdoğan,Ali Narin	2022/01/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06078v1	ArXiv	The disease called the new coronavirus (COVID19) is a new viral respiratory disease that first appeared on January 13, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Some of the symptoms of this disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing. In more serious cases, death may occur as a result of infection. COVID19 emerged as a pandemic that affected the whole world in a little while. The most important issue in the fight against the epidemic is the early diagnosis and follow-up of COVID19 (+) patients. Therefore, in addition to the RT-PCR test, medical imaging methods are also used when identifying COVID 19 (+) patients. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed using cough data, one of the most prominent symptoms of COVID19 (+) patients. The performances of z-normalization and min-max normalization methods were investigated on these data. All features were obtained using discrete wavelet transform method. Support vector machines (SVM) was used as classifier algorithm. The highest performances of accuracy and F1-score were obtained as 100% and 100% using the min-max normalization, respectively. On the other hand, the highest accuracy and highest F1-score performances were obtained as 99.2 % and 99.0 % using the z-normalization, respectively. In light of the results, it is clear that cough acoustic data will contribute significantly to controlling COVID19 cases.	1532
COVID-19 is linked to changes in the time-space dimension of human  mobility	Clodomir Santana,Federico Botta,Hugo Barbosa,Filippo Privitera,Ronaldo Menezes,Riccardo Di Clemente	2022/01/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06527v3	ArXiv	Socio-economic constructs and urban topology are crucial drivers of human mobility patterns. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, these patterns were reshaped in their components: the spatial dimension represented by the daily travelled distance, and the temporal dimension expressed as the synchronization time of commuting routines. Here, leveraging location-based data from de-identified mobile phone users, we observed that, during lockdowns restrictions, the decrease of spatial mobility is interwoven with the emergence of asynchronous mobility dynamics. The lifting of restriction in urban mobility allowed a faster recovery of the spatial dimension compared with the temporal one. Moreover, the recovery in mobility was different depending on urbanization levels and economic stratification. In rural and low-income areas, the spatial mobility dimension suffered a more considerable disruption when compared with urbanized and high-income areas. In contrast, the temporal dimension was more affected in urbanized and high-income areas than in rural and low-income areas.	1533
Estimation and Hypothesis Testing of Strain-Specific Vaccine Efficacy  with Missing Strain Types, with Applications to a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial	Fei Heng,Yanqing Sun,Peter B. Gilbert	2022/01/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08946v1	ArXiv	Statistical methods are developed for analysis of clinical and virus genetics data from phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of vaccines against novel coronavirus COVID-19. Vaccine efficacy (VE) of a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 caused by one of finitely many genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 may vary by strain. The problem of assessing differential VE by viral genetics can be formulated under a competing risks model where the endpoint is virologically confirmed COVID-19 and the cause-of-failure is the infecting SARS-CoV-2 genotype. Strain-specific VE is defined as one minus the cause-specific hazard ratio (vaccine/placebo). For the COVID-19 VE trials, the time to COVID-19 is right-censored, and a substantial percentage of failure cases are missing the infecting virus genotype. We develop estimation and hypothesis testing procedures for strain-specific VE when the failure time is subject to right censoring and the cause-of-failure is subject to missingness, focusing on $J \ge 2$ discrete categorical unordered or ordered virus genotypes. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model is used to relate the cause-specific outcomes to explanatory variables. The inverse probability weighted complete-case (IPW) estimator and the augmented inverse probability weighted complete-case (AIPW) estimator are investigated. Hypothesis tests are developed to assess whether the vaccine provides at least a specified level of efficacy against some viral genotypes and whether VE varies across genotypes, adjusting for covariates. The finite-sample properties of the proposed tests are studied through simulations and are shown to have good performances. In preparation for the real data analyses, the developed methods are applied to a pseudo dataset mimicking the Moderna COVE trial.	1534
The effect of the pandemic on complex socio-economic systems: community  detection induced by communicability	Gian Paolo Clemente,Rosanna Grassi,Giorgio Rizzini	2022/01/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12618v1	ArXiv	The increasing complexity of interrelated systems has made the use of multiplex networks an important tool for explaining the nature of relations between elements in the system. In this paper, we aim at investigating various aspects of countries' behaviour during the coronavirus pandemic period. By means of a multiplex network we consider simultaneously stringency index values, COVID-19 infections and international trade data, in order to detect clusters of countries that showed a similar reaction to the pandemic. We propose a new methodological approach based on the Estrada communicability for identifying communities on a multiplex network, based on a two-step optimization. At first, we determine the optimal inter-layer intensity between levels by minimizing a distance function. Hence, the optimal inter-layer intensity is used to detect communities on each layer. Our findings show that the community detection on this multiplex network has greater information power than classical methods for single-layer networks. Our approach better reveals clusters on each layer with respect to the application of the same approach on each single-layer. Moreover, detected groups in the multiplex case benefit of a higher cohesion, leading to identifying on each layer a lower number of communities with respect to the ones obtained in the single-layer cases.	1535
Failure of neuron network coherence induced by SARS-CoV-2-infected  astrocytes	Sergey V. Stasenko,Alexander E. Hramov,Victor B. Kazantsev	2022/10/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01014v1	ArXiv	Coherent activations of brain neuron networks underlay many physiological functions associated with various behavioral states. These synchronous fluctuations in the electrical activity of the brain are also referred to as brain rhythms. At the cellular level, the rhythmicity can be induced by various mechanisms of intrinsic oscillations in neurons or network circulation of excitation between synaptically coupled neurons. One of the specific mechanisms concerns the activity of brain astrocytes that accompany neurons and can coherently modulate synaptic contacts of neighboring neurons, synchronizing their activity. Recent studies have shown that coronavirus infection (Covid-19), entering the central nervous system and infecting astrocytes, causes various metabolic disorders. Specifically, Covid-19 can depress the synthesis of astrocytic glutamate and GABA. It is also known that in the postcovid state, patients may suffer from symptoms of anxiety and impaired cognitive functions, which may be a consequence of disturbed brain rhythms. We propose a mathematical model of a spiking neural network accompanied by astrocytes capable to generate quasi-synchronous rhythmic bursting discharges. The model predicts that if the astrocytes are infected, and the release of glutamate is depressed, then normal burst rhythmicity suffers dramatically. Interestingly, in some cases, the failure of network coherence may be intermittent with intervals of normal rhythmicity, or the synchronization can completely disappears.	1536
Self-supervised Model Based on Masked Autoencoders Advance CT Scans  Classification	Jiashu Xu,Sergii Stirenko	2022/10/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05073v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus pandemic has been going on since the year 2019, and the trend is still not abating. Therefore, it is particularly important to classify medical CT scans to assist in medical diagnosis. At present, Supervised Deep Learning algorithms have made a great success in the classification task of medical CT scans, but medical image datasets often require professional image annotation, and many research datasets are not publicly available. To solve this problem, this paper is inspired by the self-supervised learning algorithm MAE and uses the MAE model pre-trained on ImageNet to perform transfer learning on CT Scans dataset. This method improves the generalization performance of the model and avoids the risk of overfitting on small datasets. Through extensive experiments on the COVID-CT dataset and the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, we compare the SSL-based method in this paper with other state-of-the-art supervised learning-based pretraining methods. Experimental results show that our method improves the generalization performance of the model more effectively and avoids the risk of overfitting on small datasets. The model achieved almost the same accuracy as supervised learning on both test datasets. Finally, ablation experiments aim to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and how it works.	1537
MS-DCANet: A Novel Segmentation Network For Multi-Modality COVID-19  Medical Images	Xiaoyu Pan,Huazheng Zhu,Jinglong Du,Guangtao Hu,Baoru Han,Yuanyuan Jia	2022/10/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12361v4	ArXiv	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the public health burden and brought profound disaster to humans. For the particularity of the COVID-19 medical images with blurred boundaries, low contrast and different infection sites, some researchers have improved the accuracy by adding more complexity. Also, they overlook the complexity of lesions, which hinder their ability to capture the relationship between segmentation sites and the background, as well as the edge contours and global context. However, increasing the computational complexity, parameters and inference speed is unfavorable for model transfer from laboratory to clinic. A perfect segmentation network needs to balance the above three factors completely. To solve the above issues, this paper propose a symmetric automatic segmentation framework named MS-DCANet. We introduce Tokenized MLP block, a novel attention scheme that use a shift-window mechanism to conditionally fuse local and global features to get more continuous boundaries and spatial positioning capabilities. It has greater understanding of irregular lesions contours. MS-DCANet also uses several Dual Channel blocks and a Res-ASPP block to improve the ability to recognize small targets. On multi-modality COVID-19 tasks, MS-DCANet achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with other baselines. It can well trade off the accuracy and complexity. To prove the strong generalization ability of our proposed model, we apply it to other tasks (ISIC 2018 and BAA) and achieve satisfactory results.	1538
A Simple Prediction Model for the Development Trend of 2019-nCov  Epidemics Based on Medical Observations	Ye Liang,Dan Xu,Shang Fu,Kewa Gao,Jingjing Huan,Linyong Xu,Jia-da Li	2020/02/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00426v1	ArXiv	In order to predict the development trend of the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCov), we established an prediction model to predict the number of diagnoses case in China except Hubei Province. From January 25 to January 29, 2020, we optimized 6 prediction models, 5 of them based on the number of medical observations to predicts the peak time of confirmed diagnosis will appear on the period of morning of January 29 from 24:00 to February 2 before 5 o'clock 24:00. Then we tracked the data from 24 o'clock on January 29 to 24 o'clock on January 31, and found that the predicted value of the data on the 3rd has a small deviation from the actual value, and the actual value has always remained within the range predicted by the comprehensive prediction model 6. Therefore we discloses this finding and will continue to track whether this pattern can be maintained for longer. We believe that the changes medical observation case number may help to judge the trend of the epidemic situation in advance.	1539
Piecewise quadratic growth during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic	Axel Brandenburg	2020/02/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03638v4	ArXiv	The temporal growth in the number of deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic is subexponential. Here we show that a piecewise quadratic law provides an excellent fit during the thirty days after the first three fatalities on January 20 and later since the end of March 2020. There is also a brief intermediate period of exponential growth. During the second quadratic growth phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than in the beginning, which can be understood as the occurrence of separate hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth when further spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study numerical solutions of a simple epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China together with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation much earlier than the others. At each site, quadratic growth commences when the local number of infections has reached a certain saturation level. The total number of deaths does then indeed follow a piecewise quadratic behavior.	1540
Predictions of 2019-nCoV Transmission Ending via Comprehensive Methods	Tianyu Zeng,Yunong Zhang,Zhenyu Li,Xiao Liu,Binbin Qiu	2020/02/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04945v2	ArXiv	Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, a lot of predictive epidemiological models have been proposed. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as 2019-nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for comprehensive prediction researches of the 2019-nCoV.	1541
Insights from early mathematical models of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory  disease (COVID-19) dynamics	Jomar F. Rabajante	2020/02/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05296v3	ArXiv	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified to cause acute respiratory disease in humans. An outbreak of this disease has been reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter. The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during large social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. With a basic reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people. Assuming the exposure time is 18 hours, the model recommends that attendees of the social gathering should have a protection with more than 70 percent effectiveness.	1542
Dynamic Graph Correlation Learning for Disease Diagnosis with Incomplete  Labels	Daizong Liu,Shuangjie Xu,Pan Zhou,Kun He,Wei Wei,Zichuan Xu	2020/02/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11629v2	ArXiv	Disease diagnosis on chest X-ray images is a challenging multi-label classification task. Previous works generally classify the diseases independently on the input image without considering any correlation among diseases. However, such correlation actually exists, for example, Pleural Effusion is more likely to appear when Pneumothorax is present. In this work, we propose a Disease Diagnosis Graph Convolutional Network (DD-GCN) that presents a novel view of investigating the inter-dependency among different diseases by using a dynamic learnable adjacency matrix in graph structure to improve the diagnosis accuracy. To learn more natural and reliable correlation relationship, we feed each node with the image-level individual feature map corresponding to each type of disease. To our knowledge, our method is the first to build a graph over the feature maps with a dynamic adjacency matrix for correlation learning. To further deal with a practical issue of incomplete labels, DD-GCN also utilizes an adaptive loss and a curriculum learning strategy to train the model on incomplete labels. Experimental results on two popular chest X-ray (CXR) datasets show that our prediction accuracy outperforms state-of-the-arts, and the learned graph adjacency matrix establishes the correlation representations of different diseases, which is consistent with expert experience. In addition, we apply an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in DD-GCN.	1543
Diagnosing COVID-19 Pneumonia from X-Ray and CT Images using Deep  Learning and Transfer Learning Algorithms	Halgurd S. Maghdid,Aras T. Asaad,Kayhan Zrar Ghafoor,Ali Safaa Sadiq,Muhammad Khurram Khan	2020/03/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00038v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 (also known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus) first emerged in Wuhan, China and spread across the globe with unprecedented effect and has now become the greatest crisis of the modern era. The COVID-19 has proved much more pervasive demands for diagnosis that has driven researchers to develop more intelligent, highly responsive and efficient detection methods. In this work, we focus on proposing AI tools that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals to diagnose COVID-19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of a publicly available dataset of X-ray and CT images makes the design of such AI tools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive dataset of X-rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides a simple but an effective COVID-19 detection technique using deep learning and transfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network (CNN) and modified pre-trained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X-rays and CT scan images dataset. The result of the experiments shows that the utilized models can provide accuracy up to 98 % via pre-trained network and 94.1 % accuracy by using the modified CNN.	1544
Containment efficiency and control strategies for the Corona pandemic  costs	Claudius Gros,Roser Valenti,Lukas Schneider,Kilian Valenti,Daniel Gros	2020/04/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00493v3	ArXiv	The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with the problem of measuring the effectiveness of containment strategies, balancing public health considerations with the economic costs of social distancing measures. We introduce a modified epidemic model that we name the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rate evolves dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. An analytic solution is presented. The model reproduces official COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions and countries that surpassed the first peak of the outbreak. A single unbiased feedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index that measures the efficiency of containment strategies (the CEI index). CEI values for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the controlled-SIR model, detailed estimates of the total medical and socio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic. Costs comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, strict measures fare better than a hands-off policy. Strategies based on current case numbers lead to substantially higher total costs than strategies based on the overall history of the epidemic.	1545
Power-law distribution in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases	Bernd Blasius	2020/04/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00940v2	ArXiv	COVID-19 is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first reported on in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and spatial scales of response in which to mitigate future epidemic threats.	1546
Large-scale ligand-based virtual screening for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors  using deep neural networks	Markus Hofmarcher,Andreas Mayr,Elisabeth Rumetshofer,Peter Ruch,Philipp Renz,Johannes Schimunek,Philipp Seidl,Andreu Vall,Michael Widrich,Sepp Hochreiter,Günter Klambauer	2020/03/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00979v3	ArXiv	"Due to the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there is an urgent need for novel therapies and drugs. We conducted a large-scale virtual screening for small molecules that are potential CoV-2 inhibitors. To this end, we utilized ""ChemAI"", a deep neural network trained on more than 220M data points across 3.6M molecules from three public drug-discovery databases. With ChemAI, we screened and ranked one billion molecules from the ZINC database for favourable effects against CoV-2. We then reduced the result to the 30,000 top-ranked compounds, which are readily accessible and purchasable via the ZINC database. Additionally, we screened the DrugBank using ChemAI to allow for drug repurposing, which would be a fast way towards a therapy. We provide these top-ranked compounds of ZINC and DrugBank as a library for further screening with bioassays at https://github.com/ml-jku/sars-cov-inhibitors-chemai."	1547
Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Imaging Data  Acquisition, Segmentation and Diagnosis for COVID-19	Feng Shi,Jun Wang,Jun Shi,Ziyan Wu,Qian Wang,Zhenyu Tang,Kelei He,Yinghuan Shi,Dinggang Shen	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02731v2	ArXiv	(This paper was submitted as an invited paper to IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering on April 6, 2020.) The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.	1548
Protocol for an Observational Study on the Effects of Social Distancing  on Influenza-Like Illness and COVID-19	Bo Zhang,Ting Ye,Siyu Heng,Michael Z. Levy,Dylan S. Small	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02944v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since spread around the globe, claiming more than 69,000 lives by the time this protocol is written. It has been widely acknowledged that the most effective public policy to mitigate the pandemic is \emph{social and physical distancing}: keeping at least six feet away from people, working from home, closing non-essential businesses, etc. There have been a lot of anecdotal evidences suggesting that social distancing has a causal effect on disease mitigation; however, few studies have investigated the effect of social distancing on disease mitigation in a transparent and statistically-sound manner.   We propose to perform an optimal non-bipartite matching to pair counties with similar observed covariates but vastly different average social distancing scores during the first week (March 16th through Match 22nd) of President's \emph{15 Days to Slow the Spread} campaign. We have produced a total of $302$ pairs of two U.S. counties with good covariate balance on a total of $16$ important variables. Our primary outcome will be the average observed illness collected by Kinsa Inc. two weeks after the intervention period. Although the observed illness does not directly measure COVID-19, it reflects a real-time aspect of the pandemic, and unlike confirmed cases, it is much less confounded by counties' testing capabilities. We also consider observed illness three weeks after the intervention period as a secondary outcome. We will test a proportional treatment effect using a randomization-based test with covariance adjustment and conduct a sensitivity analysis.	1549
State Space Advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Map approach for automatic and non  Invasive diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease	Ioannis D. Apostolopoulos,Peter P. Groumpos,Dimitris I. Apostolopoulos	2020/04/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03372v2	ArXiv	Purpose: In this study, the recently emerged advances in Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) are investigated and employed, for achieving the automatic and non-invasive diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Methods: A Computer-Aided Diagnostic model for the acceptable and non-invasive prediction of CAD using the State Space Advanced FCM (AFCM) approach is proposed. Also, a rule-based mechanism is incorporated, to further increase the knowledge of the system and the interpretability of the decision mechanism. The proposed method is tested utilizing a CAD dataset from the Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine of the University of Patras. More specifically, two architectures of AFCMs are designed, and different parameter testing is performed. Furthermore, the proposed AFCMs, which are based on the new equations proposed recently, are compared with the traditional FCM approach. Results: The experiments highlight the effectiveness of the AFCM approach and the new equations over the traditional approach, which obtained an accuracy of 78.21%, achieving an increase of seven percent (+7%) on the classification task, and obtaining 85.47% accuracy. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that the AFCM approach in developing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps outperforms the conventional approach, while it constitutes a reliable method for the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease. Conclusions and future research related to recent pandemic of coronavirus are provided.	1550
Divergent modes of online collective attention to the COVID-19 pandemic  are associated with future caseload variance	David Rushing Dewhurst,Thayer Alshaabi,Michael V. Arnold,Joshua R. Minot,Christopher M. Danforth,Peter Sheridan Dodds	2020/04/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03516v2	ArXiv	Using a random 10% sample of tweets authored from 2019-09-01 through 2020-04-30, we analyze the dynamic behavior of words (1-grams) used on Twitter to describe the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Across 24 languages, we find two distinct dynamic regimes: One characterizing the rise and subsequent collapse in collective attention to the initial Coronavirus outbreak in late January, and a second that represents March COVID-19-related discourse. Aggregating countries by dominant language use, we find that volatility in the first dynamic regime is associated with future volatility in new cases of COVID-19 roughly three weeks (average 22.49 $\pm$ 3.26 days) later. Our results suggest that surveillance of change in usage of epidemiology-related words on social media may be useful in forecasting later change in disease case numbers, but we emphasize that our current findings are not causal or necessarily predictive.	1551
Screening of Therapeutic Agents for COVID-19 using Machine Learning and  Ensemble Docking Simulations	Rohit Batra,Henry Chan,Ganesh Kamath,Rampi Ramprasad,Mathew J. Cherukara,Subramanian Sankaranarayanan	2020/04/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03766v1	ArXiv	The world has witnessed unprecedented human and economic loss from the COVID-19 disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Extensive research is being conducted across the globe to identify therapeutic agents against the SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a powerful and efficient computational strategy by combining machine learning (ML) based models and high-fidelity ensemble docking simulations to enable rapid screening of possible therapeutic molecules (or ligands). Our screening is based on the binding affinity to either the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host receptor region or to the Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex, thereby potentially limiting and/or disrupting the host-virus interactions. We first apply our screening strategy to two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral) to identify hundreds of ligands that bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems. Candidate ligands were then validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were subsequently used to screen a large bio-molecule dataset (with nearly a million entries) to provide a rank-ordered list of ~19,000 potentially useful compounds for further validation. Overall, this work not only expands our knowledge of small-molecule treatment against COVID-19, but also provides an efficient pathway to perform high-throughput computational drug screening by combining quick ML surrogate models with expensive high-fidelity simulations, for accelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases.	1552
Dynamic causal modelling of COVID-19	Karl J. Friston,Thomas Parr,Peter Zeidman,Adeel Razi,Guillaume Flandin,Jean Daunizeau,Oliver J. Hulme,Alexander J. Billig,Vladimir Litvak,Rosalyn J. Moran,Cathy J. Price,Christian Lambert	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04463v1	ArXiv	This technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of coronavirus through a population. The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.	1553
DeepCOVIDExplainer: Explainable COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on Chest X-ray  Images	Md. Rezaul Karim,Till Döhmen,Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann,Stefan Decker,Michael Cochez,Oya Beyan	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04582v3	ArXiv	Amid the coronavirus disease(COVID-19) pandemic, humanity experiences a rapid increase in infection numbers across the world. Challenge hospitals are faced with, in the fight against the virus, is the effective screening of incoming patients. One methodology is the assessment of chest radiography(CXR) images, which usually requires expert radiologist's knowledge. In this paper, we propose an explainable deep neural networks(DNN)-based method for automatic detection of COVID-19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call DeepCOVIDExplainer. We used 15,959 CXR images of 15,854 patients, covering normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. CXR images are first comprehensively preprocessed, before being augmented and classified with a neural ensemble method, followed by highlighting class-discriminating regions using gradient-guided class activation maps(Grad-CAM++) and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP). Further, we provide human-interpretable explanations of the predictions. Evaluation results based on hold-out data show that our approach can identify COVID-19 confidently with a positive predictive value(PPV) of 91.6%, 92.45%, and 96.12%; precision, recall, and F1 score of 94.6%, 94.3%, and 94.6%, respectively for normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases, respectively, making it comparable or improved results over recent approaches. We hope that our findings will be a useful contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and, in more general, towards an increasing acceptance and adoption of AI-assisted applications in the clinical practice.	1554
Modeling Epidemic Spreading through Public Transit using Time-Varying  Encounter Network	Baichuan Mo,Kairui Feng,Yu Shen,Clarence Tam,Daqing Li,Yafeng Yin,Jinhua Zhao	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04602v2	ArXiv	"Passenger contact in public transit (PT) networks can be a key mediate in the spreading of infectious diseases. This paper proposes a time-varying weighted PT encounter network to model the spreading of infectious diseases through the PT systems. Social activity contacts at both local and global levels are also considered. We select the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a case study along with smart card data from Singapore to illustrate the model at the metropolitan level. A scalable and lightweight theoretical framework is derived to capture the time-varying and heterogeneous network structures, which enables to solve the problem at the whole population level with low computational costs. Different control policies from both the public health side and the transportation side are evaluated. We find that people's preventative behavior is one of the most effective measures to control the spreading of epidemics. From the transportation side, partial closure of bus routes helps to slow down but cannot fully contain the spreading of epidemics. Identifying ""influential passengers"" using the smart card data and isolating them at an early stage can also effectively reduce the epidemic spreading."	1555
Efficiency of Covid-19 Mobile Contact Tracing Containment by Measuring  Time Dependent Doubling Time	Antonio Bianconi,Augusto Marcelli,Gaetano Campi,Andrea Perali	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04604v3	ArXiv	The Covid-19 epidemic of the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS - CoV-2) has been spreading around the world. While different containment policies using non-pharmaceutical interventions have been applied, their efficiency are not known quantitatively. We show that the doubling time Td(t) with the success s factor, the characteristic time of the exponential growth of Td(t) in the arrested regime, is a reliable tool for early predictions of epidemic spread time evolution and it provides a quantitative measure of the success of different containment measures. The efficiency of the containment policy Lockdown case Finding mobile Tracing (LFT) using mandatory mobile contact tracing is much higher than the Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) policy proposed by the Imperial College team in London. A very low s factor was reached by LFT policy giving the shortest time width of the dome of positive case curve and the lowest number of fatalities. The LFT policy has been able to reduce by a factor 100 the number of fatalities in the first 100 days of the Covid-19 epidemic, to reduce the time width of the Covid-19 pandemic dome by a factor 2.5 and to rapidly stop new outbreaks avoiding the second wave	1556
A time-dependent SEIR model to analyse the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2  epidemic outbreak in Portugal	Pedro Teles	2020/04/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04735v5	ArXiv	Background: The analysis of the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic is of paramount importance to understand the dynamics of the coronavirus spread. This can help health and government authorities take the appropriate measures and implement suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about 1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about 22,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200/300 in ICU units. This seems manageable by the country national health service with an estimated 1,140 ventilators.	1557
Low-Cost and High-Throughput Testing of COVID-19 Viruses and Antibodies  via Compressed Sensing: System Concepts and Computational Experiments	Jirong Yi,Raghu Mudumbai,Weiyu Xu	2020/04/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05759v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic infectious disease outbreak that has significantly harmed and threatened the health and lives of millions or even billions of people. COVID-19 has also negatively impacted the social and economic activities of many countries significantly. With no approved vaccine available at this moment, extensive testing of COVID-19 viruses in people are essential for disease diagnosis, virus spread confinement, contact tracing, and determining right conditions for people to return to normal economic activities. Identifying people who have antibodies for COVID-19 can also help select persons who are suitable for undertaking certain essential activities or returning to workforce. However, the throughputs of current testing technologies for COVID-19 viruses and antibodies are often quite limited, which are not sufficient for dealing with COVID-19 viruses' anticipated fast oscillating waves of spread affecting a significant portion of the earth's population.   In this paper, we propose to use compressed sensing (group testing can be seen as a special case of compressed sensing when it is applied to COVID-19 detection) to achieve high-throughput rapid testing of COVID-19 viruses and antibodies, which can potentially provide tens or even more folds of speedup compared with current testing technologies. The proposed compressed sensing system for high-throughput testing can utilize expander graph based compressed sensing matrices developed by us \cite{Weiyuexpander2007}.	1558
COVID-19 forecasting based on an improved interior search algorithm and  multi-layer feed forward neural network	Rizk M. Rizk-Allah,Aboul Ella Hassanien	2020/04/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05960v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was emerged in December 2019 within Wuhan, China. As the crisis of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS) becomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days based on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model, named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented. The proposed model is investigated in the most affected countries (i.e., USA, Italy, and Spain). The experimental simulations illustrate that the proposed ISACL-MFNN provides promising performance rather than the other algorithms while forecasting task for the candidate countries.	1559
The effect of stay-at-home orders on COVID-19 cases and fatalities in  the United States	James H. Fowler,Seth J. Hill,Remy Levin,Nick Obradovich	2020/04/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06098v4	ArXiv	"Governments issue ""stay at home"" orders to reduce the spread of contagious diseases, but the magnitude of such orders' effectiveness is uncertain. In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level in the United States. We estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results suggest that stay-at-home orders reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to 680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three weeks in localities where they were implemented."	1560
An automatic COVID-19 CT segmentation network using spatial and channel  attention mechanism	Tongxue Zhou,Stéphane Canu,Su Ruan	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06673v4	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a devastating effect on the global public health. Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in the screening of COVID-19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately segment COVID-19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this paper, we propose a U-Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial and a channel attention, to a U-Net architecture to re-weight the feature representation spatially and channel-wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation on COVID-19 segmentation. The method takes only 0.29 second to segment a single CT slice. The obtained Dice Score, Sensitivity and Specificity are 83.1%, 86.7% and 99.3%, respectively.	1561
Weakly Supervised Deep Learning for COVID-19 Infection Detection and  Classification from CT Images	Shaoping Hu,Yuan Gao,Zhangming Niu,Yinghui Jiang,Lao Li,Xianglu Xiao,Minhao Wang,Evandro Fei Fang,Wade Menpes-Smith,Jun Xia,Hui Ye,Guang Yang	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06689v1	ArXiv	An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic around the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.	1562
Determination of an Optimal Control Strategy for Vaccine Administration  in COVID-19 Pandemic Treatment	Gustavo Barbosa Libotte,Fran Sérgio Lobato,Gustavo Mendes Platt,Antônio José da Silva Neto	2020/04/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07397v2	ArXiv	During decades, mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior of physical and biologic systems, and to define strategies aiming the minimization of the effects regarding different types of diseases. In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. To solve such inverse problem, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After this step, two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal control problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The results regarding the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be chosen, according to a given criterion.	1563
Correlates of the country differences in the infection and mortality  rates during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Bayesian  model averaging	Viktor Stojkoski,Zoran Utkovski,Petar Jolakoski,Dragan Tevdovski,Ljupco Kocarev	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07947v9	ArXiv	In the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic we observed great discrepancies in both infection and mortality rates between countries. Besides the biological and epidemiological factors, a multitude of social and economic criteria also influence the extent to which these discrepancies appear. Consequently, there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic and health factors that correlate with the infection and mortality rates outcome of the pandemic. Here, we leverage Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate the potential of 28 variables, describing a diverse set of health and socio-economic characteristics, in being correlates of the final number of infections and deaths during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. We show that only few variables are able to robustly correlate with these outcomes. To understand the relationship between the potential correlates in explaining the infection and death rates, we create a Jointness Space. Using this space, we conclude that the extent to which each variable is able to provide a credible explanation for the COVID-19 infections/mortality outcome varies between countries because of their heterogeneous features.	1564
Simulation of Covid-19 epidemic evolution: are compartmental models  really predictive?	Marco Paggi	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08207v1	ArXiv	Computational models for the simulation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic evolution would be extremely useful to support authorities in designing healthcare policies and lockdown measures to contain its impact on public health and economy. In Italy, the devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data-driven approach, by fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models, which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model, suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training, and that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore reliable -- predictions.	1565
Estimating and Projecting Air Passenger Traffic during the COVID-19  Coronavirus Outbreak and its Socio-Economic Impact	Stefano Maria Iacus,Fabrizio Natale,Carlos Satamaria,Spyridon Spyratos,Michele Vespe	2020/04/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08460v2	ArXiv	The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to this hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban.	1566
Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Population Mobility under Mild  Policies: Causal Evidence from Sweden	Matz Dahlberg,Per-Anders Edin,Erik Grönqvist,Johan Lyhagen,John Östh,Alexey Siretskiy,Marina Toger	2020/04/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09087v1	ArXiv	Sweden has adopted far less restrictive social distancing policies than most countries following the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses data on all mobile phone users, from one major Swedish mobile phone network, to examine the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak under the Swedish mild recommendations and restrictions regime on individual mobility and if changes in geographical mobility vary over different socio-economic strata. Having access to data for January-March in both 2019 and 2020 enables the estimation of causal effects of the COVID-19 outbreak by adopting a Difference-in-Differences research design. The paper reaches four main conclusions: (i) The daytime population in residential areas increased significantly (64 percent average increase); (ii) The daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased significantly (33 percent average decrease); (iii) The distance individuals move from their homes during a day was substantially reduced (38 percent decrease in the maximum distance moved and 36 percent increase in share of individuals who move less than one kilometer from home); (iv) Similar reductions in mobility were found for residents in areas with different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. These results show that mild government policies can compel people to adopt social distancing behavior.	1567
Firefly-Algorithm Supported Scheme to Detect COVID-19 Lesion in Lung CT  Scan Images using Shannon Entropy and Markov-Random-Field	Venkatesan Rajinikanth,Seifedine Kadry,Krishnan Palani Thanaraj,Krishnamurthy Kamalanand,Sanghyun Seo	2020/04/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09239v1	ArXiv	The pneumonia caused by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is one of major global threat and a number of detection and treatment procedures are suggested by the researchers for COVID-19. The proposed work aims to suggest an automated image processing scheme to extract the COVID-19 lesion from the lung CT scan images (CTI) recorded from the patients. This scheme implements the following procedures; (i) Image pre-processing to enhance the COVID-19 lesions, (ii) Image post-processing to extract the lesions, and (iii) Execution of a relative analysis between the extracted lesion segment and the Ground-Truth-Image (GTI). This work implements Firefly Algorithm and Shannon Entropy (FA+SE) based multi-threshold to enhance the pneumonia lesion and implements Markov-Random-Field (MRF) segmentation to extract the lesions with better accuracy. The proposed scheme is tested and validated using a class of COVID-19 CTI obtained from the existing image datasets and the experimental outcome is appraised to authenticate the clinical significance of the proposed scheme. The proposed work helped to attain a mean accuracy of >92% during COVID-19 lesion segmentation and in future, it can be used to examine the real clinical lung CTI of COVID-19 patients.	1568
ICT Intervention in the Containment of the Pandemic Spread of COVID-19:  An Exploratory Study	Akib Zaman,Muhammad Nazrul Islam,Tarannum Zaki,Mohammad Sajjad Hossain	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09888v1	ArXiv	The objective of this article is to explore the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) interventions and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the containment of the pandemic spread of novel Coronavirus. The research adopted a qualitative research approach, while the study data were collected through online content review and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Starting with a preliminary set of about 1200 electronic resources or contents, 56 were selected for review study, applying an inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review study revealed ICT interventions that include websites and dashboards, mobile applications, robotics and drones, artificial intelligence (AI), data analytic, wearable and sensor technology, social media and learning tools, and interactive voice response (IVR) as well as explored their respective usages to combat the pandemic spread of COVID-19. Later, the FGD was replicated with 22 participants and explored the possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of deploying such technologies to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This research not only explores the exiting status of ICT interventions to fight with the COVID-19 pandemic but also provides a number of implications for the government, practitioners, doctors, policymakers and researchers for the effective utilization of the existing ICT interventions and for the future potential research and technological development to the containment of the pandemic spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics.	1569
The Ivory Tower Lost: How College Students Respond Differently than the  General Public to the COVID-19 Pandemic	Viet Duong,Phu Pham,Tongyu Yang,Yu Wang,Jiebo Luo	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09968v1	ArXiv	Recently, the pandemic of the novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has presented governments with ultimate challenges. In the United States, the country with the highest confirmed COVID-19 infection cases, a nationwide social distancing protocol has been implemented by the President. For the first time in a hundred years since the 1918 flu pandemic, the US population is mandated to stay in their households and avoid public contact. As a result, the majority of public venues and services have ceased their operations. Following the closure of the University of Washington on March 7th, more than a thousand colleges and universities in the United States have cancelled in-person classes and campus activities, impacting millions of students. This paper aims to discover the social implications of this unprecedented disruption in our interactive society regarding both the general public and higher education populations by mining people's opinions on social media. We discover several topics embedded in a large number of COVID-19 tweets that represent the most central issues related to the pandemic, which are of great concerns for both college students and the general public. Moreover, we find significant differences between these two groups of Twitter users with respect to the sentiments they expressed towards the COVID-19 issues. To our best knowledge, this is the first social media-based study which focuses on the college student community's demographics and responses to prevalent social issues during a major crisis.	1570
Syndromic surveillance using search query logs and user location  information from smartphones against COVID-19 clusters in Japan	Shohei Hisada,Taichi Murayama,Kota Tsubouchi,Sumio Fujita,Shuntaro Yada,Shoko Wakamiya,Eiji Aramaki	2020/04/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10100v1	ArXiv	[Background] Two clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were confirmed in Hokkaido, Japan in February 2020. To capture the clusters, this study employs Web search query logs and user location information from smartphones. [Material and Methods] First, we anonymously identified smartphone users who used a Web search engine (Yahoo! JAPAN Search) for the COVID-19 or its symptoms via its companion application for smartphones (Yahoo Japan App). We regard these searchers as Web searchers who are suspicious of their own COVID-19 infection (WSSCI). Second, we extracted the location of the WSSCI via the smartphone application. The spatio-temporal distribution of the number of WSSCI are compared with the actual location of the known two clusters. [Result and Discussion] Before the early stage of the cluster development, we could confirm several WSSCI, which demonstrated the basic feasibility of our WSSCI-based approach. However, it is accurate only in the early stage, and it was biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. For the case where the other cluster-related resources, such as fine-grained population statistics, are not available, the proposed metric would be helpful to catch the hint of emerging clusters.	1571
Modelling strong control measures for epidemic propagation with networks  -- A COVID-19 case study	Michael Small,David Cavanagh	2020/04/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10396v4	ArXiv	"We show that precise knowledge of epidemic transmission parameters is not required to build an informative model of the spread of disease. We propose a detailed model of the topology of the contact network under various external control regimes and demonstrate that this is sufficient to capture the salient dynamical characteristics and to inform decisions. Contact between individuals in the community is characterised by a contact graph, the structure of that contact graph is selected to mimic community control measures. Our model of city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph (elimination of mass gatherings); and (c) small world lattice (partial to full lockdown -- ""social"" distancing). This model exhibits good qualitative agreement between simulation and data from the 2020 pandemic spread of coronavirus. Estimates of the relevant rate parameters of the SEIR model are obtained and we demonstrate the robustness of our model predictions under uncertainty of those estimates. The social context and utility of this work is identified, contributing to a highly effective pandemic response in Western Australia."	1572
Deep Learning for Screening COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images	Sanhita Basu,Sushmita Mitra,Nilanjan Saha	2020/04/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10507v4	ArXiv	"With the ever increasing demand for screening millions of prospective ""novel coronavirus"" or COVID-19 cases, and due to the emergence of high false negatives in the commonly used PCR tests, the necessity for probing an alternative simple screening mechanism of COVID-19 using radiological images (like chest X-Rays) assumes importance. In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes \textit{viz.} $normal$, $pneumonia$, $other\_disease$, and $Covid-19$. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as $90.13\% \pm 0.14$. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with clinical findings, as validated by experts."	1573

Weld,Oren Etzioni,Sebastian Kohlmeier	2020/04/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10706v4	ArXiv	The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a growing resource of scientific papers on COVID-19 and related historical coronavirus research. CORD-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and information retrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and structured full text papers. Since its release, CORD-19 has been downloaded over 200K times and has served as the basis of many COVID-19 text mining and discovery systems. In this article, we describe the mechanics of dataset construction, highlighting challenges and key design decisions, provide an overview of how CORD-19 has been used, and describe several shared tasks built around the dataset. We hope this resource will continue to bring together the computing community, biomedical experts, and policy makers in the search for effective treatments and management policies for COVID-19.	1574
Mobile phone location data reveal the effect and geographic variation of  social distancing on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic	Song Gao,Jinmeng Rao,Yuhao Kang,Yunlei Liang,Jake Kruse,Doerte Doepfer,Ajay K. Sethi,Juan Francisco Mandujano Reyes,Jonathan Patz,Brian S. Yandell	2020/04/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11430v1	ArXiv	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. Social (physical) distancing is a key non-pharmacologic control measure to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2, but high-level adherence is needed. Using daily travel distance and stay-at-home time derived from large-scale anonymous mobile phone location data provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates have been followed in the U.S. and its effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The correlation between the COVID-19 growth rate and travel distance decay rate and dwell time at home change rate was -0.586 (95% CI: -0.742 ~ -0.370) and 0.526 (95% CI: 0.293 ~ 0.700), respectively. Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.04 ~ 6.86 days to 3.66 ~ 30.29 days after social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with mechanistic epidemic prediction models. Social distancing mandates reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.	1575
Estimation of Infection Rate and Prediction of Initial Infected  Individuals of COVID-19	Seo Yoon Chae,Kyoung-Eun Lee,Hyun Min Lee,Nam Jun,Quang Ahn Le,Biseko Juma Mafwele,Tae Ho Lee,Doo Hwan Kim,Jae Woo Lee	2020/04/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12665v1	ArXiv	We consider the pandemic spreading of COVID-19 for some selected countries after the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan City, China. We estimated the infection rate and the initial infected individuals of COVID-19 by using the officially reported data at the early stage of the epidemic for the susceptible (S), infectable (I), quarantined (Q), and the cofirmed recovered (Rk) population model, so called SIQRk model. In the reported data we know the quarantined cases and the recovered cases. We can not know the recovered cases from the asymptomatic cases. In the SIQRk model we can estimated the model parameters and the initial infecting cases (confirmed ans asymtomatic cases) from the data fits. We obtained the infection rate in the range between 0.233 and 0.462, the basic reproduction number Ro in the range between 1.8 and 3.5, and the initial number of infected individuals in the range betwee 10 and 8409 for some selected countries. By using fitting parameters we estimated the maximum time of the infection for Germany when the government are performing the quarantine policy. The disease is undergoing to the calm state about six months after first patients were identified.	1576
Mobility Based SIR Model For Pandemics -- With Case Study Of COVID-19	Rahul Goel,Rajesh Sharma	2020/04/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13015v1	ArXiv	In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS, H1N1, and presently novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On one side, scientists are focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared, especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of our model, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data to demonstrate our model's generalizability. To demonstrate the wider scope of our model, we used our model to forecast the COVID-19 cases for Estonia.	1577
Development of a Machine-Learning System to Classify Lung CT Scan Images  into Normal/COVID-19 Class	Seifedine Kadry,Venkatesan Rajinikanth,Seungmin Rho,Nadaradjane Sri Madhava Raja,Vaddi Seshagiri Rao,Krishnan Palani Thanaraj	2020/04/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13122v1	ArXiv	Recently, the lung infection due to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) affected a large human group worldwide and the assessment of the infection rate in the lung is essential for treatment planning. This research aims to propose a Machine-Learning-System (MLS) to detect the COVID-19 infection using the CT scan Slices (CTS). This MLS implements a sequence of methods, such as multi-thresholding, image separation using threshold filter, feature-extraction, feature-selection, feature-fusion and classification. The initial part implements the Chaotic-Bat-Algorithm and Kapur's Entropy (CBA+KE) thresholding to enhance the CTS. The threshold filter separates the image into two segments based on a chosen threshold 'Th'. The texture features of these images are extracted, refined and selected using the chosen procedures. Finally, a two-class classifier system is implemented to categorize the chosen CTS (n=500 with a pixel dimension of 512x512x1) into normal/COVID-19 group. In this work, the classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with linear kernel (SVM) are implemented and the classification task is performed using various feature vectors. The experimental outcome of the SVM with Fused-Feature-Vector (FFV) helped to attain a detection accuracy of 89.80%.	1578
Lights and shadows of COVID-19, Technology and Industry 4.0	Nicola Melluso,Silvia Fareri,Gualtiero Fantoni,Andrea Bonaccorsi,Filippo Chiarello,Elena Coli,Vito Giordano,Pietro Manfredi,Shahin Manafi	2020/04/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13457v1	ArXiv	"Scientific discoveries and technologies played a significant role in the digital revolution that occurred over the last years. But what is their role in the turmoil brought by the current pandemic? The aim of this paper is to show how digital technologies are operating during this first phase of the spreading of COVID-19. The study analyses and debates the current and potential role of digital technologies, focusing on their influence in the industrial and social fields. More specifically we used the blogging platform ""Medium"", which has seen an exponential growth in its production of articles over the last couple of months. Even if different from esteemed scientific sources, this platform provides a structure that suits our analysis. We searched how many times digital technologies are mentioned in articles regarding Coronavirus and, after collecting these articles, we collected page tags (comparable to ""keywords"" in scientific articles) and classified them (technology tags and non-technology tags), to create a graph showing the relation between them. This network allowed us to acknowledge and picture how technologies are currently debated. This was the starting point to discuss the key implications for an imminent future, and question about the impact on industry, society and labour market. What are the opportunities or threats of using technologies of Industry 4.0? Which are the needs rising because of the pandemic and how can technologies help in their fulfillment? How will the industrial scenario change after this pandemic? How will the labour market be affected? How can technologies be advantageous in the emerging social challenges?"	1579
Predicting Infection of COVID-19 in Japan: State Space Modeling Approach	Genya Kobayashi,Shonosuke Sugasawa,Hiromasa Tamae,Takayuki Ozu	2020/04/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13483v1	ArXiv	The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Japan has been increasing day by day and has had a serious impact on the society especially after the declaration of the state of emergency on April 7, 2020. This study analyzes the real time data from March 1 to April 22, 2020 by adopting a sophisticated statistical modeling tool based on the state space model combined with the well-known susceptible-exposed-infected (SIR) model. The model estimation and forecasting are conducted using the Bayesian methodology. The present study provides the parameter estimates of the unknown parameters that critically determine the epidemic process derived from the SIR model and prediction of the future transition of the infectious proportion including the size and timing of the epidemic peak with the prediction intervals that naturally accounts for the uncertainty. The prediction results under various scenarios reveals that the temporary reduction in the infection rate until the planned lifting of the state on May 6 will only delay the epidemic peak slightly. In order to minimize the spread of the epidemic, it is strongly suggested that an intervention is carried out for an extended period of time and that the government and individuals make a long term effort to reduce the infection rate even after the lifting.	1580
CoronaVis: A Real-time COVID-19 Tweets Data Analyzer and Data Repository	Md. Yasin Kabir,Sanjay Madria	2020/04/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13932v2	ArXiv	Due to the nature of the data and public interaction, twitter is becoming more and more useful to understand and model various events. The goal of CoronaVis is to use tweets as the information shared by the people to visualize topic modeling, study subjectivity, and to model the human emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective is to explore the psychology and behavior of the societies at large which can assist in managing the economic and social crisis during the ongoing pandemic as well as the after-effects of it. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced people to stay at home to reduce the spread of the virus by maintaining social distancing. However, social media is keeping people connected both locally and globally. People are sharing information (e.g. personal opinions, some facts, news, status, etc.) on social media platforms which can be helpful to understand the various public behavior such as emotions, sentiments, and mobility during the ongoing pandemic. In this work, we develop a live application to observe the tweets on COVID-19 generated from the USA. In this paper, we have generated various data analytics over a period of time to study the changes in topics, subjectivity, and human emotions. We also share a cleaned and processed dataset named CoronaVis Twitter dataset (focused on the United States) available to the research community at https://github.com/mykabir/COVID19. This will enable the community to find more useful insights and create different applications and models to fight with COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics as well.	1581
Spatiotemporal Dynamics, Nowcasting and Forecasting of COVID-19 in the  United States	Li Wang,Guannan Wang,Lei Gao,Xinyi Li,Shan Yu,Myungjin Kim,Yueying Wang,Zhiling Gu	2020/04/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14103v4	ArXiv	Epidemic modeling is an essential tool to understand the spread of the novel coronavirus and ultimately assist in disease prevention, policymaking, and resource allocation. In this article, we establish a state of the art interface between classic mathematical and statistical models and propose a novel space-time epidemic modeling framework to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of infectious disease. We propose a quasi-likelihood approach via the penalized spline approximation and alternatively reweighted least-squares technique to estimate the model. Furthermore, we provide a short-term and long-term county-level prediction of the infected/death count for the U.S. by accounting for the control measures, health service resources, and other local features. Utilizing spatiotemporal analysis, our proposed model enhances the dynamics of the epidemiological mechanism and dissects the spatiotemporal structure of the spreading disease. To assess the uncertainty associated with the prediction, we develop a projection band based on the envelope of the bootstrap forecast paths. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by a simulation study. We apply the proposed method to model and forecast the spread of COVID-19 at both county and state levels in the United States.	1582
The Effects of Stringent Interventions for Coronavirus Pandemic	Ting Tian,Wenxiang Luo,Yukang Jiang,Minqiong Chen,Canhong Wen,Wenliang Pan,Xueqin Wang	2020/05/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00523v1	ArXiv	The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe public health consequences around the world. Many interventions of COVID-19 have been implemented. It is of great public health and societal importance to evaluate the effects of interventions in the pandemic of COVID-19. In this paper, with help of synthetic control method, regression discontinuity and a Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized in isolation-Removed (SIHR) model, we evaluate the horizontal and longitudinal effects of stringent interventions implemented in Wenzhou, a representative urban city of China, where stringent interventions were enforced to curb its own epidemic situation with rapidly increasing newly confirmed cases. We found that there were statistically significant treatment effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of COVID-19. The slower the interventions were implemented, the more severe the epidemic would have been, and the stronger the interventions would have been required.	1583
COVID-19: Social Media Sentiment Analysis on Reopening	Mohammed Emtiaz Ahmed,Md Rafiqul Islam Rabin,Farah Naz Chowdhury	2020/06/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00804v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the most talked topic in social media platforms in 2020. People are using social media such as Twitter to express their opinion and share information on a number of issues related to the COVID-19 in this stay at home order. In this paper, we investigate the sentiment and emotion of peoples in the United States on the subject of reopening. We choose the social media platform Twitter for our analysis and study the Tweets to discover the sentimental perspective, emotional perspective, and triggering words towards the reopening. During this COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have made some analysis on various social media dataset regarding lockdown and stay at home. However, in our analysis, we are particularly interested to analyse public sentiment on reopening. Our major finding is that when all states resorted to lockdown in March, people showed dominant emotion of fear, but as reopening starts people have less fear. While this may be true, due to this reopening phase daily positive cases are rising compared to the lockdown situation. Overall, people have a less negative sentiment towards the situation of reopening.	1584
Comparing and Integrating US COVID-19 Data from Multiple Sources with  Anomaly Detection and Repairing	Guannan Wang,Zhiling Gu,Xinyi Li,Shan Yu,Myungjin Kim,Yueying Wang,Lei Gao,Li Wang	2020/06/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01333v4	ArXiv	Over the past few months, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been expanding over the world. A reliable and accurate dataset of the cases is vital for scientists to conduct related research and for policy-makers to make better decisions. We collect the United States COVID-19 daily reported data from four open sources: the New York Times, the COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins University, the COVID Tracking Project at the Atlantic, and the USAFacts, then compare the similarities and differences among them. To obtain reliable data for further analysis, we first examine the cyclical pattern and the following anomalies, which frequently occur in the reported cases: (1) the order dependencies violation, (2) the point or period anomalies, and (3) the issue of reporting delay. To address these detected issues, we propose the corresponding repairing methods and procedures if corrections are necessary. In addition, we integrate the COVID-19 reported cases with the county-level auxiliary information of the local features from official sources, such as health infrastructure, demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information, which are also essential for understanding the spread of the virus.	1585
ARIMA forecasting of COVID-19 incidence in Italy, Russia, and the USA	Gaetano Perone	2020/05/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01754v2	ArXiv	The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory infection that officially occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In late February, the disease began to spread quickly across the world, causing serious health, social, and economic emergencies. This paper aims to forecast the short to medium-term incidence of COVID-19 epidemic through the medium of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, applied to Italy, Russia, and the USA The analysis is carried out on the number of new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, collected by Worldometer website. The best ARIMA models are Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results show that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to stabilize; ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19 infections in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively; and iii) Russia and the USA will require much more time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near zero. This may suggest the importance of the application of quick and effective lockdown measures, which have been relatively stricter in Italy. Therefore, even if the results should be interpreted with caution, ARIMA models seem to be a good tool that can help the health authorities to monitor the diffusion of the outbreak.	1586
Predicting Mortality Risk in Viral and Unspecified Pneumonia to Assist  Clinicians with COVID-19 ECMO Planning	Helen Zhou,Cheng Cheng,Zachary C. Lipton,George H. Chen,Jeremy C. Weiss	2020/06/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01898v1	ArXiv	Respiratory complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 have claimed tens of thousands of lives in 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 escalate from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) to viral pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to death. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-sustaining oxygenation and ventilation therapy that may be used for patients with severe ARDS when mechanical ventilation is insufficient to sustain life. While early planning and surgical cannulation for ECMO can increase survival, clinicians report the lack of a risk score hinders these efforts. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop the PEER score, used to highlight critically ill patients with viral or unspecified pneumonia at high risk of mortality or decompensation in a subpopulation eligible for ECMO. The PEER score is validated on two large, publicly available critical care databases and predicts mortality at least as well as other existing risk scores. Stratifying our cohorts into low-risk and high-risk groups, we find that the high-risk group also has a higher proportion of decompensation indicators such as vasopressor and ventilator use. Finally, the PEER score is provided in the form of a nomogram for direct calculation of patient risk, and can be used to highlight at-risk patients among critical care patients eligible for ECMO.	1587
COVID-19 diagnosis by routine blood tests using machine learning	Matjaž Kukar,Gregor Gunčar,Tomaž Vovko,Simon Podnar,Peter Černelč,Miran Brvar,Mateja Zalaznik,Mateja Notar,Sašo Moškon,Marko Notar	2020/06/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03476v1	ArXiv	Physicians taking care of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have described different changes in routine blood parameters. However, these changes, hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnosis. We constructed a machine learning predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model was based and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5,333 patients with various bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 97.9%. The cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis. We believe that our results present a significant contribution to improvements in COVID-19 diagnosis.	1588
A new estimation method for COVID-19 time-varying reproduction number  using active cases	A. Hasan,H. Susanto,V. R. Tjahjono,R. Kusdiantara,E. R. M. Putri,P. Hadisoemarto,N. Nuraini	2020/06/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03766v3	ArXiv	We propose a new method to estimate the time-varying effective (or instantaneous) reproduction number of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g., age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where the positive rates were below 5\% recommended by WHO.	1589
The Covid-19 pandemic's effects on poor rural dwellers in sub-Saharan  Africa: A case study of access to basic clean water, sanitary systems and  hand-washing facilities	John Stephen Kayode,Asha Embrandiri,Adijat Olubukola Olateju	2020/06/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04468v1	ArXiv	The fear of the invisible but prevalent Coronavirus (COVID-19), disease cannot be overemphasized since there is the potential possibility of it wiping out the entire world population within a few months if adequate and quick steps are not taken to curb this menace, and the sub-Saharan African (SSAn) region is no exception. It is evident that water, as an essential daily commodity, has long been in a state of emergency in SSAn nations, which is largely attributed to decades of neglect by the successive governments, because it has not been possible to separate the existing bond between water, health, livelihood and the economy. The laudable Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) proposed by the United Nations had yet to achieve the stated objective of improving the standards of living and health conditions of the rural communities in the SSAn region before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This failure has been masked by a sort of delusion in which the people of this region are subjected to the hardship of searching for clean and healthy water in their own ponds, rivers, streams and shallow hand-dug local wells on a continuous basis. Less than 17% of the rural population in all the SSAn communities can access basic hand-washing facilities and sanitation systems. The total water productivity, as measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per cubic meter of total freshwater withdrawn, for the people was less than 5 GDP.	1590
Comparison of Citations Trends between the COVID-19 Pandemic and  SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, Avian and Swine Influenza Epidemics	Artemis Chaleplioglou,Daphne Kyriaki-Manessi	2020/06/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05366v1	ArXiv	Objective: The novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak rapidly evolved into pandemic. Global research efforts focus on this topic and with the collaboration of the scientific journals publication industry produced more than 16,000 related published articles in PubMed within five months from the onset of the outbreak. Herein, a comparison of the COVID-19 citations in PubMed and Web of Science was performed with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, avian and swine influenza epidemics. Methods: The citations were searched and collected using the disease terms and the date of publication restriction. The total number of PubMed citations and the HIV associated papers during the same chronological periods were examined in parallel. The journal category and country information of the publications were gathered from Web of Science. The collected data were statistically analyzed and compared. Results: Significant correlations were found between COVID-19 and MERS (CC=0.988; p=0.003; q=0.006), Ebola (CC=0.987; p=0.003; q=0.011), and SARS (CC=0.964; p=0.015; q=0.028) epidemics five-month pick of novel citations in PubMed. However, COVID-19 publications were accumulated earlier and in larger numbers than any other 21st century major communicable disease outbreak. Conclusion: The acceleration and the total number of COVID-19 publications represent an unprecedented landmark event in the medical library history. The immediate adoption of the fast-track peer-reviewing and publishing as well as the open access publication policies by the journal publishers are significant contributors to this bibliographic phenomenon.	1591
Semiparametric Bayesian Inference for the Transmission Dynamics of  COVID-19 with a State-Space Model	Tianjian Zhou,Yuan Ji	2020/06/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05581v2	ArXiv	The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic affecting over 200 countries and regions. Inference about the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 can provide important insights into the speed of disease spread and the effects of mitigation policies. We develop a novel Bayesian approach to such inference based on a probabilistic compartmental model using data of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. In particular, we consider a probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered model, which takes into account undocumented infections and allows the epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated datasets. Finally, our approach is applied to COVID-19 data from four states of the United States: Washington, New York, California, and Illinois. An R package BaySIR is made available at https://github.com/tianjianzhou/BaySIR for the public to conduct independent analysis or reproduce the results in this paper.	1592
Optimal immunity control by social distancing for the SIR epidemic model	Pierre-Alexandre Bliman,Michel Duprez,Yannick Privat,Nicolas Vauchelet	2020/06/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05733v1	ArXiv	Until a vaccine or therapy is found against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, reaching herd immunity appears to be the only mid-term option. However, if the number of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond this threshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected until the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article, using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary measures put in place in France from March to May 2020. We also analyze the minimum intervention time to reach a fixed distance from herd immunity, and show the relationship with the previous problem. Simulations are provided that illustrate and validate the theoretical results.	1593
Mathematical Modeling of Business Reopening when Facing SARS-CoV-2  Pandemic: Protection, Cost and Risk	Hongyu Miao,Qianmiao Gao,Han Feng,Chengxue Zhong,Pengwei Zhu,Liang Wu,Michael D. Swartz,Xi Luo,Stacia M. DeSantis,Dejian Lai,Cici Bauer,Adriana Pérez,Libin Rong,David Lairson	2020/05/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06416v2	ArXiv	The sudden onset of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in tremendous loss of human life and economy in more than 210 countries and territories around the world. While self-protections such as wearing mask, sheltering in place and quarantine polices and strategies are necessary for containing virus transmission, tens of millions people in the U.S. have lost their jobs due to the shutdown of businesses. Therefore, how to reopen the economy safely while the virus is still circulating in population has become a problem of significant concern and importance to elected leaders and business executives. In this study, mathematical modeling is employed to quantify the profit generation and the infection risk simultaneously from the point of view of a business entity. Specifically, an ordinary differential equation model was developed to characterize disease transmission and infection risk. An algebraic equation is proposed to determine the net profit that a business entity can generate after reopening and take into account the costs associated of several protection/quarantine guidelines. All model parameters were calibrated based on various data and information sources. Sensitivity analyses and case studies were performed to illustrate the use of the model in practice.	1594
Coronavirus Contact Tracing: Evaluating The Potential Of Using Bluetooth  Received Signal Strength For Proximity Detection	Douglas J. Leith,Stephen Farrell	2020/05/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06822v1	ArXiv	We report on measurements of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) received signal strength taken on mobile handsets in a variety of common, real-world settings. We note that a key difficulty is obtaining the ground truth as to when people are in close proximity to one another. Knowledge of this ground truth is important for accurately evaluating the accuracy with which contact events are detected by Bluetooth LE. We approach this by adopting a scenario-based approach. In summary, we find that the Bluetooth LE received signal strength can vary substantially depending on the relative orientation of handsets, on absorption by the human body, reflection/absorption of radio signals in buildings and trains. Indeed we observe that the received signal strength need not decrease with increasing distance. This suggests that the development of accurate methods for proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal strength is likely to be challenging. Our measurements also suggest that combining use of Bluetooth LE contact tracing apps with adoption of new social protocols may yield benefits but this requires further investigation. For example, placing phones on the table during meetings is likely to simplify proximity detection using received signal strength. Similarly, carrying handbags with phones placed close to the outside surface. In locations where the complexity of signal propagation makes proximity detection using received signal strength problematic entry/exit from the location might instead be logged in an app by e.g. scanning a time-varying QR code or the like.	1595
Using Mobility for Electrical Load Forecasting During the COVID-19  Pandemic	Yize Chen,Weiwei Yang,Baosen Zhang	2020/06/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08826v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges for the utilities and grid operators around the world. In this work, we focus on the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions, power consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and daily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in short-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing information and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot capture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic. In this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to complement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data acts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the implementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major challenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are associated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we design a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between several different geographical regions. This architecture leverages the diversity across these regions and the resulting aggregated model can boost the algorithm performance in each region's day-ahead forecast. Through simulations for regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform conventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to project how electricity consumption would recover based on different mobility scenarios.	1596
CO-Search: COVID-19 Information Retrieval with Semantic Search, Question  Answering, and Abstractive Summarization	Andre Esteva,Anuprit Kale,Romain Paulus,Kazuma Hashimoto,Wenpeng Yin,Dragomir Radev,Richard Socher	2020/06/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09595v1	ArXiv	The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in international efforts to understand, track, and mitigate the disease, yielding a significant corpus of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-related publications across scientific disciplines. As of May 2020, 128,000 coronavirus-related publications have been collected through the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. Here we present CO-Search, a retriever-ranker semantic search engine designed to handle complex queries over the COVID-19 literature, potentially aiding overburdened health workers in finding scientific answers during a time of crisis. The retriever is built from a Siamese-BERT encoder that is linearly composed with a TF-IDF vectorizer, and reciprocal-rank fused with a BM25 vectorizer. The ranker is composed of a multi-hop question-answering module, that together with a multi-paragraph abstractive summarizer adjust retriever scores. To account for the domain-specific and relatively limited dataset, we generate a bipartite graph of document paragraphs and citations, creating 1.3 million (citation title, paragraph) tuples for training the encoder. We evaluate our system on the data of the TREC-COVID information retrieval challenge. CO-Search obtains top performance on the datasets of the first and second rounds, across several key metrics: normalized discounted cumulative gain, precision, mean average precision, and binary preference.	1597
The effect of extended closure of red-light areas on COVID-19  transmission in India	Abhishek Pandey,Sudhakar V. Nuti,Pratha Sah,Chad R. Wells,Alison P. Galvani,Jeffrey P. Townsend	2020/06/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10488v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in over 200,000 cases in India. Thus far, India has implemented lockdown measures to curb disease transmission. However, commercial sex work in red-light areas (RLAs) has potential to lead to COVID-19 resurgence after lockdown. We developed a model of COVID-19 transmission in RLAs, evaluating the impact of extended RLA closure compared with RLA reopening on cases, hospitalizations, and mortality rates within the RLAs of five major Indian cities, within the cities, and across India. Closure lowered transmission at all scales. More than 90% of cumulative cases and deaths among RLA residents of Kolkata, Pune, and Nagpur could be averted by the time the epidemic would peak under a re-opening scenario. Across India, extended closure of RLAs would benefit the population at large, delaying the peak of COVID-19 cases by 8 to 23 days, and avert 32% to 60.2% of cumulative cases and 43% to 67.6% of cumulative deaths at the peak of the epidemic. Extended closure of RLAs until better prevention and treatment strategies are developed would benefit public health in India.	1598
Computational model on COVID-19 Pandemic using Probabilistic Cellular  Automata	Sayantari Ghosh,Saumik Bhattacharya	2020/06/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11270v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which is caused by SARS-COV2 has become a pandemic. This disease is highly infectious and potentially fatal, causing a global public health concern. To contain the spread of COVID-19, governments are adopting nationwide interventions, like lockdown, containment and quarantine, restrictions on travel, cancelling social events and extensive testing. To understand the effects of these measures on the control of the epidemic in a data-driven manner, we propose a probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) based modified SEIQR model. The transitions associated with the model is driven by data available on chronology, symptoms, pathogenesis and transmissivity of the virus. By arguing that the lattice-based model captures the features of the dynamics along with the existing fluctuations, we perform rigorous computational analyses of the model to take into account of the spatial dynamics of social distancing measures imposed on the people. Considering the probabilistic behavioural aspects associated with mitigation strategies, we study the model considering factors like population density and testing efficiency. Using the model, we focus on the variability of epidemic dynamics data for different countries and point out the reasons behind these contrasting observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model COVID-19 spread using PCA that gives us both spatial and temporal variations of the infection spread with the insight about the contributions of different infection parameters.	1599
Mathematical modeling and prediction of COVID-19 in Moscow city and  Novosibirsk region	Olga Krivorotko,Sergey Kabanikhin,Nikolay Zyatkov,Alexey Prikhodko,Nikita Prokhoshin,Maxim Shishlenin	2020/06/18			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12619v1	ArXiv	The paper formulates and solves the problem of identification of unknown parameters of mathematical models of the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus infection, based on SEIR type models, based on additional information about the number of detected cases, mortality, self-isolation coefficient and tests performed for the Moscow city and the Novosibirsk Region from 03.23.2020. Within the framework of the models used, the population is divided into seven (SEIR-HCD) and five (SEIR-D) groups with similar characteristics with transition probabilities between groups depending on a specific region. Identifiability analysis of the SEIR-HCD mathematical model was carried out, which revealed the least sensitive unknown parameters to additional measurements. The tasks of refining the parameters are reduced to minimizing the corresponding target functionals, which were solved using stochastic methods (simulating annealing, differential evolution, genetic algorithm, etc.). For a different amount of tested data, a prognostic scenario for the development of the disease in the city of Moscow and the Novosibirsk region was developed, the peak is predicted the development of the epidemic in Moscow with an error of 2 days and 174 detected cases, and an analysis of the applicability of the developed models was carried out.	1600
Momentum Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot COVID-19 Diagnosis from Chest  CT Images	Xiaocong Chen,Lina Yao,Tao Zhou,Jinming Dong,Yu Zhang	2020/06/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13276v1	ArXiv	The current pandemic, caused by the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in December 2019, has led to a global emergency that has significantly impacted economies, healthcare systems and personal wellbeing all around the world. Controlling the rapidly evolving disease requires highly sensitive and specific diagnostics. While real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly used, these can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from healthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and automatic diagnostic system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising direction. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient training samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use contrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature representations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the prototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the proposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly available and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our model for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 based on chest CT images.	1601
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of COVID-19 Cases Using LSTM and  ARIMA Models	Arko Barman	2020/06/05			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13852v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health crisis that has been declared a pandemic by World Health Organization. Forecasting country-wise COVID-19 cases is necessary to help policymakers and healthcare providers prepare for the future. This study explores the performance of several Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model in forecasting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Time series of daily cumulative COVID-19 cases were used for generating 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day forecasts using several LSTM models and ARIMA. Two novel k-period performance metrics - k-day Mean Absolute Percentage Error (kMAPE) and k-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) - were developed for evaluating the performance of the models in forecasting time series values for multiple days. Errors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as 0.05%, while those for ARIMA were 0.07% and 0.06% respectively. LSTM models slightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly overestimated the numbers in the forecasts. The performance of LSTM models is comparable to ARIMA in forecasting COVID-19 cases. While ARIMA requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform reasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3. However, LSTMs require a large number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period performance metrics proposed is likely to be useful for performance evaluation of time series models in predicting multiple periods. Based on the k-period performance metrics proposed, both LSTMs and ARIMA are useful for time series analysis and forecasting for COVID-19.	1602
COVIDLite: A depth-wise separable deep neural network with white balance  and CLAHE for detection of COVID-19	Manu Siddhartha,Avik Santra	2020/06/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13873v1	ArXiv	Background and Objective:Currently, the whole world is facing a pandemic disease, novel Coronavirus also known as COVID-19, which spread in more than 200 countries with around 3.3 million active cases and 4.4 lakh deaths approximately. Due to rapid increase in number of cases and limited supply of testing kits, availability of alternative diagnostic method is necessary for containing the spread of COVID-19 cases at an early stage and reducing the death count. For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we proposed a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily integrated with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using Chest X-rays (CXR) images. Methods:In this study, we have proposed a method named COVIDLite, which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is used as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images and DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification with lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without quantization. Results:The proposed COVIDLite method resulted in improved performance in comparison to vanilla DSCNN with no pre-processing. The proposed method achieved higher accuracy of 99.58% for binary classification, whereas 96.43% for multiclass classification and out-performed various state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion:Our proposed method, COVIDLite achieved exceptional results on various performance metrics. With detailed model interpretations, COVIDLite can assist radiologists in detecting COVID-19 patients from CXR images and can reduce the diagnosis time significantly.	1603
Does Non-COVID19 Lung Lesion Help? Investigating Transferability in  COVID-19 CT Image Segmentation	Yixin Wang,Yao Zhang,Yang Liu,Jiang Tian,Cheng Zhong,Zhongchao Shi,Yang Zhang,Zhiqiang He	2020/06/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13877v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus spreading all around the world. Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions. Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.	1604
Structural Identifiability and Observability of Compartmental Models of  the COVID-19 Pandemic	Gemma Massonis,Julio R. Banga,Alejandro F. Villaverde	2020/06/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14295v1	ArXiv	The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights -- as well as the possibility of controlling the system -- may be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model.

Study of lockdown/testing mitigation strategies on stochastic SIR model  and its comparison with South Korea, Germany and New York data	Priyanka,Vicky Verma	2020/06/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14373v1	ArXiv	We are currently facing a highly critical case of a world-wide pandemic. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, a.k.a. COVID-19) has proved to be extremely contagious and the original outbreak from Asia has now spread to all continents. This situation will fruitfully profit from the study in regards of the spread of the virus, assessing effective countermeasures to weight the impact of the adopted strategies. The standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is a very successful and widely used mathematical model for predicting the spread of an epidemic. We adopt the SIR model on a random network and extend the model to include control strategies {\em lockdown} and {\em testing} -- two often employed mitigation strategies. The ability of these strategies in controlling the pandemic spread is investigated by varying the effectiveness with which they are implemented. The possibility of a second outbreak is evaluated in detail after the mitigation strategies are withdrawn. We notice that, in any case, a sudden interruption of such mitigation strategies will likely induce a resurgence of a second outbreak, whose peak will be correlated to the number of susceptible individuals. In fact, we find that a population will remain vulnerable to the infection until the herd immunity is achieved. We also test our model with real statistics and information on the epidemic spread in South Korea, Germany, and New York and find a remarkable agreement with the simulation data.	1606
TweetsCOV19 -- A Knowledge Base of Semantically Annotated Tweets about  the COVID-19 Pandemic	Dimitar Dimitrov,Erdal Baran,Pavlos Fafalios,Ran Yu,Xiaofei Zhu,Matthäus Zloch,Stefan Dietze	2020/06/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14492v4	ArXiv	Publicly available social media archives facilitate research in the social sciences and provide corpora for training and testing a wide range of machine learning and natural language processing methods. With respect to the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), online discourse on Twitter reflects public opinion and perception related to the pandemic itself as well as mitigating measures and their societal impact. Understanding such discourse, its evolution, and interdependencies with real-world events or (mis)information can foster valuable insights. On the other hand, such corpora are crucial facilitators for computational methods addressing tasks such as sentiment analysis, event detection, or entity recognition. However, obtaining, archiving, and semantically annotating large amounts of tweets is costly. In this paper, we describe TweetsCOV19, a publicly available knowledge base of currently more than 8 million tweets, spanning October 2019 - April 2020. Metadata about the tweets as well as extracted entities, hashtags, user mentions, sentiments, and URLs are exposed using established RDF/S vocabularies, providing an unprecedented knowledge base for a range of knowledge discovery tasks. Next to a description of the dataset and its extraction and annotation process, we present an initial analysis and use cases of the corpus.	1607
Forecasting the daily and cumulative number of cases for the COVID-19  pandemic in India	Subhas Khajanchi,Kankan Sarkar	2020/06/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14575v1	ArXiv	The ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the Govt. of India has declared a nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020, to prevent community transmission of COVID-19. Due to absence of specific antivirals or vaccine, mathematical modeling play an important role to better understand the disease dynamics and designing strategies to control rapidly spreading infectious diseases. In our study, we developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We calibrated our proposed model with daily COVID-19 data for the four Indian provinces, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of the model including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$. The disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of infected individuals increased but if the disease transmission rate remains higher then the endemic equilibrium always remain stable. For the estimated model parameters, $\mathcal{R}_0 >1$ for all the four provinces, which suggests the significant outbreak of COVID-19. Short-time prediction shows the increasing trend of daily and cumulative cases of COVID-19 for the four provinces of India.	1608
Machine-Learning Driven Drug Repurposing for COVID-19	Semih Cantürk,Aman Singh,Patrick St-Amant,Jason Behrmann	2020/06/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14707v1	ArXiv	The integration of machine learning methods into bioinformatics provides particular benefits in identifying how therapeutics effective in one context might have utility in an unknown clinical context or against a novel pathology. We aim to discover the underlying associations between viral proteins and antiviral therapeutics that are effective against them by employing neural network models. Using the National Center for Biotechnology Information virus protein database and the DrugVirus database, which provides a comprehensive report of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) and viruses they inhibit, we trained ANN models with virus protein sequences as inputs and antiviral agents deemed safe-in-humans as outputs. Model training excluded SARS-CoV-2 proteins and included only Phases II, III, IV and Approved level drugs. Using sequences for SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) as inputs to the trained models produces outputs of tentative safe-in-human antiviral candidates for treating COVID-19. Our results suggest multiple drug candidates, some of which complement recent findings from noteworthy clinical studies. Our in-silico approach to drug repurposing has promise in identifying new drug candidates and treatments for other viruses.	1609
C19-TraNet: an empirical, global index-case transmission network of  SARS-CoV-2	Vikram Singh,Vikram Singh	2020/06/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15162v1	ArXiv	Originating in Wuhan, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has astonished health-care systems across globe due to its rapid and simultaneous spread to the neighboring and distantly located countries. To gain the systems level understanding of the role of global transmission routes in the COVID-19 spread, in this study, we have developed the first, empirical, global, index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 termed as C19-TraNet. We manually curated the travel history of country wise index-cases using government press releases, their official social media handles and online news reports to construct this C19-TraNet that is a spatio-temporal, sparse, growing network comprising of 187 nodes and 199 edges and follows a power-law degree distribution. To model the growing C19-TraNet, a novel stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm is proposed that accounts for stochastic addition of both nodes as well as edges at each time step. A peculiar connectivity pattern in C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a fourth degree polynomial growth curve, that significantly diverges from the average random connectivity pattern obtained from an ensemble of its 1,000 SSF realizations. Partitioning the C19-TraNet, using edge betweenness, it is found that most of the large communities are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of countries belonging to different world regions suggesting that there are no spatial constraints on the spread of disease. This work characterizes the superspreaders that have very quickly transported the virus, through multiple transmission routes, to long range geographical locations alongwith their local neighborhoods.	1610
End-to-End AI-Based Point-of-Care Diagnosis System for Classifying  Respiratory Illnesses and Early Detection of COVID-19	Abdelkader Nasreddine Belkacem,Sofia Ouhbi,Abderrahmane Lakas,Elhadj Benkhelifa,Chao Chen	2020/06/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15469v1	ArXiv	Respiratory symptoms can be a caused by different underlying conditions, and are often caused by viral infections, such as Influenza-like illnesses or other emerging viruses like the Coronavirus. These respiratory viruses, often, have common symptoms, including coughing, high temperature, congested nose, and difficulty breathing. However, early diagnosis of the type of the virus, can be crucial, especially in cases such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. One of the factors that contributed to the spread of the pandemic, was the late diagnosis or confusing it with regular flu-like symptoms. Science has proved that one of the possible differentiators of the underlying causes of these different respiratory diseases is coughing, which comes in different types and forms. Therefore, a reliable lab-free tool for early and more accurate diagnosis that can differentiate between different respiratory diseases is very much needed. This paper proposes an end-to-end portable system that can record data from patients with symptom, including coughs (voluntary or involuntary) and translate them into health data for diagnosis, and with the aid of machine learning, classify them into different respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. With the ongoing efforts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease everywhere today, and against similar diseases in the future, our proposed low cost and user-friendly solution can play an important part in the early diagnosis.	1611
Investigating the association between meteorological factors and the  transmission and fatality of COVID-19 in the US	Meijian Yang	2020/07/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00028v1	ArXiv	A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is sweeping the world and has taken away thousands of lives. As the current epicenter, the United States has the largest number of confirmed and death cases of COVID-19. Meteorological factors have been found associated with many respiratory diseases in the past studies. In order to understand that how and during which period of time do the meteorological factors have the strongest association with the transmission and fatality of COVID-19, we analyze the correlation between each meteorological factor during different time periods within the incubation window and the confirmation and fatality rate, and develop statistic models to quantify the effects at county level. Results show that meteorological variables except maximum wind speed during the day 13 - 0 before current day shows the most significant correlation (P < 0.05) with the daily confirmed rate, while temperature during the day 13 - 8 before are most significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with the daily fatality rate. Temperature is the only meteorological factor showing dramatic positive association nationally, particularly in the southeast US where the current outbreak most intensive. The influence of temperature is remarkable on the confirmed rate with an increase of over 5 pmp in many counties, but not as much on the fatality rate (mostly within 0.01%). Findings in this study will help understanding the role of meteorological factors in the spreading of COVID-19 and provide insights for public and individual in fighting against this global epidemic.	1612
Dissecting contact tracing apps in the Android platform	Vasileios Kouliaridis,Georgios Kambourakis,Efstratios Chatzoglou,Dimitrios Geneiatakis,Hua Wang	2020/08/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00214v5	ArXiv	Contact tracing has historically been used to retard the spread of infectious diseases, but if it is exercised by hand in large-scale, it is known to be a resource-intensive and quite deficient process. Nowadays, digital contact tracing has promptly emerged as an indispensable asset in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The work at hand offers a meticulous study of all the official Android contact tracing apps deployed hitherto by European countries. Each app is closely scrutinized both statically and dynamically by means of dynamic instrumentation. Depending on the level of examination, static analysis results are grouped in two axes. The first encompasses permissions, API calls, and possible connections to external URLs, while the second concentrates on potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, including the use of trackers, in-depth manifest analysis, shared software analysis, and taint analysis. Dynamic analysis on the other hand collects data pertaining to Java classes and network traffic. The results demonstrate that while overall these apps are well-engineered, they are not free of weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations that may ultimately put the user security and privacy at risk.	1613
An artificial intelligence system for predicting the deterioration of  COVID-19 patients in the emergency department	Farah E. Shamout,Yiqiu Shen,Nan Wu,Aakash Kaku,Jungkyu Park,Taro Makino,Stanisław Jastrzębski,Jan Witowski,Duo Wang,Ben Zhang,Siddhant Dogra,Meng Cao,Narges Razavian,David Kudlowitz,Lea Azour,William Moore,Yvonne W. Lui,Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs,Carlos Fernandez-Granda,Krzysztof J. Geras	2020/08/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01774v2	ArXiv	During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, rapid and accurate triage of patients at the emergency department is critical to inform decision-making. We propose a data-driven approach for automatic prediction of deterioration risk using a deep neural network that learns from chest X-ray images and a gradient boosting model that learns from routine clinical variables. Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3,661 patients, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.745-0.830) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at New York University Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time. In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for assisting front-line physicians in the triage of COVID-19 patients.	1614
Impact of COVID-19 on Public Transit Accessibility and Ridership	Michael Wilbur,Afiya Ayman,Anna Ouyang,Vincent Poon,Riyan Kabir,Abhiram Vadali,Philip Pugliese,Daniel Freudberg,Aron Laszka,Abhishek Dubey	2020/08/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02413v1	ArXiv	Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9% and 65.1% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77% vs 58%) in Nashville.	1615
Data-driven Inferences of Agency-level Risk and Response Communication  on COVID-19 through Social Media based Interactions	Md Ashraf Ahmed,Arif Mohaimin Sadri,M. Hadi Amini	2020/08/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03866v1	ArXiv	Risk and response communication of public agencies through social media played a significant role in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and such interactions were echoed in other information outlets. This study collected time-sensitive online social media data and analyzed such communication patterns from public health (WHO, CDC), emergency (FEMA), and transportation (FDOT) agencies using data-driven methods. The scope of the work includes a detailed understanding of how agencies communicate risk information through social media during a pandemic and influence community response (i.e. timing of lockdown, timing of reopening) and disease outbreak indicators (i.e. number of confirmed cases, number of deaths). The data includes Twitter interactions from different agencies (2.15K tweets per agency on average) and crowdsourced data (i.e. Worldometer) on COVID-19 cases and deaths were observed between February 21, 2020 and June 06, 2020. Several machine learning techniques such as (i.e. topic mining and sentiment ratings over time) are applied here to identify the dynamics of emergent topics during this unprecedented time. Temporal infographics of the results captured the agency-levels variations over time in circulating information about the importance of face covering, home quarantine, social distancing and contact tracing. In addition, agencies showed differences in their discussions about community transmission, lack of personal protective equipment, testing and medical supplies, use of tobacco, vaccine, mental health issues, hospitalization, hurricane season, airports, construction work among others. Findings could support more efficient transfer of risk and response information as communities shift to new normal as well as in future pandemics.	1616
Logistic equation and COVID-19	Efim Pelinovsky,Andrey Kurkin,Oxana Kurkina,Maria Kokoulina,Anastasia Epifanova	2020/08/13			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05937v1	ArXiv	The generalized logistic equation is used to interpret the COVID-19 epidemic data in several countries: Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and South Korea. The model coefficients are calculated: the growth rate and the expected number of infected people, as well as the exponent indexes in the generalized logistic equation. It is shown that the dependence of the number of the infected people on time is well described on average by the logistic curve (within the framework of a simple or generalized logistic equation) with a determination coefficient exceeding 0.8. At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate can reach 60%. The variability spectra of the coefficients have characteristic peaks at periods of several days, which corresponds to the observed serial intervals. The use of the stochastic logistic equation is proposed to estimate the number of probable peaks in the coronavirus incidence.	1617
Statistical Analytics and Regional Representation Learning for COVID-19  Pandemic Understanding	Shayan Fazeli,Babak Moatamed,Majid Sarrafzadeh	2020/08/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07342v1	ArXiv	The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has severely impacted almost all countries around the world. It not only has caused a tremendous burden on health-care providers to bear, but it has also brought severe impacts on the economy and social life. The presence of reliable data and the results of in-depth statistical analyses provide researchers and policymakers with invaluable information to understand this pandemic and its growth pattern more clearly. This paper combines and processes an extensive collection of publicly available datasets to provide a unified information source for representing geographical regions with regards to their pandemic-related behavior. The features are grouped into various categories to account for their impact based on the higher-level concepts associated with them. This work uses several correlation analysis techniques to observe value and order relationships between features, feature groups, and COVID-19 occurrences. Dimensionality reduction techniques and projection methodologies are used to elaborate on individual and group importance of these representative features. A specific RNN-based inference pipeline called DoubleWindowLSTM-CP is proposed in this work for predictive event modeling. It utilizes sequential patterns and enables concise record representation while using but a minimal amount of historical data. The quantitative results of our statistical analytics indicated critical patterns reflecting on many of the expected collective behavior and their associated outcomes. Predictive modeling with DoubleWindowLSTM-CP instance exhibits efficient performance in quantitative and qualitative assessments while reducing the need for extended and reliable historical information on the pandemic.	1618
Fast Accurate Point of Care COVID-19 Pandemic Diagnosis Enabled Through  Advanced Lab-on-a-Chip Optical Biosensors: Opportunities and Challenges	Aref Asghari,Chao Wang,Kyoung Min Yoo,Hamed Dalir,Ray T. Chen	2020/08/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08572v1	ArXiv	The sudden rise of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic early 2020 throughout the world has called into drastic action measures to do instant detection and reduce the spread rate. The common diagnostics testing methods has been only partially effective in satisfying the booming demand for fast detection methods to contain the further spread. However, the point-of-risk accurate diagnosis of this new emerging viral infection is paramount as simultaneous normal working operation and dealing with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 can become the norm for years to come. Sensitive cost-effective biosensor with mass production capability is crucial throughout the world until a universal vaccination become available. Optical label-free biosensors can provide a non-invasive, extremely sensitive rapid detection technique up to ~1 fM concentration along with few minutes sensing. These biosensors can be manufactured on a mass-scale (billions) to detect the COVID-19 viral load in nasal, saliva, urinal, and serological samples even if the infected person is asymptotic. Methods investigated here are the most advanced available platforms for biosensing optical devices resulted from the integration of state-of-the-art designs and materials. These approaches are including but not limited to integrated optical devices, plasmonic resonance and also emerging nanomaterial biosensors. The lab-on-a-chip platforms examined here are suitable not only for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection but also other contagious virions such as influenza, and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS).	1619
Comparative performance analysis of the ResNet backbones of Mask RCNN to  segment the signs of COVID-19 in chest CT scans	Muhammad Aleem,Rahul Raj,Arshad Khan	2020/08/21			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09713v1	ArXiv	"COVID-19 has been detrimental in terms of the number of fatalities and rising number of critical patients across the world. According to the UNDP (United National Development Programme) Socio-Economic programme, aimed at the COVID-19 crisis, the pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. There has been greater developments recently in the chest X-ray-based imaging technique as part of the COVID-19 diagnosis especially using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for recognising and classifying images. However, given the limitation of supervised labelled imaging data, the classification and predictive risk modelling of medical diagnosis tend to compromise. This paper aims to identify and monitor the effects of COVID-19 on the human lungs by employing Deep Neural Networks on axial CT (Chest Computed Tomography) scan of lungs. We have adopted Mask RCNN, with ResNet50 and ResNet101 as its backbone, to segment the regions, affected by COVID-19 coronavirus. Using the regions of human lungs, where symptoms have manifested, the model classifies condition of the patient as either ""Mild"" or ""Alarming"". Moreover, the model is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to simulate the online usage of the model for performance evaluation and accuracy improvement. The ResNet101 backbone model produces an F1 score of 0.85 and faster prediction scores with an average time of 9.04 seconds per inference."	1620
Symbolic Semantic Segmentation and Interpretation of COVID-19 Lung  Infections in Chest CT volumes based on Emergent Languages	Aritra Chowdhury,Alberto Santamaria-Pang,James R. Kubricht,Jianwei Qiu,Peter Tu	2020/08/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09866v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in a pandemic crippling the a breadth of services critical to daily life. Segmentation of lung infections in computerized tomography (CT) slices could be be used to improve diagnosis and understanding of COVID-19 in patients. Deep learning systems lack interpretability because of their black box nature. Inspired by human communication of complex ideas through language, we propose a symbolic framework based on emergent languages for the segmentation of COVID-19 infections in CT scans of lungs. We model the cooperation between two artificial agents - a Sender and a Receiver. These agents synergistically cooperate using emergent symbolic language to solve the task of semantic segmentation. Our game theoretic approach is to model the cooperation between agents unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Sender retrieves information from one of the higher layers of the deep network and generates a symbolic sentence sampled from a categorical distribution of vocabularies. The Receiver ingests the stream of symbols and cogenerates the segmentation mask. A private emergent language is developed that forms the communication channel used to describe the task of segmentation of COVID infections. We augment existing state of the art semantic segmentation architectures with our symbolic generator to form symbolic segmentation models. Our symbolic segmentation framework achieves state of the art performance for segmentation of lung infections caused by COVID-19. Our results show direct interpretation of symbolic sentences to discriminate between normal and infected regions, infection morphology and image characteristics. We show state of the art results for segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections in CT.	1621
Cross-Cultural Polarity and Emotion Detection Using Sentiment Analysis  and Deep Learning -- a Case Study on COVID-19	Ali Shariq Imran,Sher Mohammad Doudpota,Zenun Kastrati,Rakhi Bhatra	2020/08/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10031v1	ArXiv	How different cultures react and respond given a crisis is predominant in a society's norms and political will to combat the situation. Often the decisions made are necessitated by events, social pressure, or the need of the hour, which may not represent the will of the nation. While some are pleased with it, others might show resentment. Coronavirus (COVID-19) brought a mix of similar emotions from the nations towards the decisions taken by their respective governments. Social media was bombarded with posts containing both positive and negative sentiments on the COVID-19, pandemic, lockdown, hashtags past couple of months. Despite geographically close, many neighboring countries reacted differently to one another. For instance, Denmark and Sweden, which share many similarities, stood poles apart on the decision taken by their respective governments. Yet, their nation's support was mostly unanimous, unlike the South Asian neighboring countries where people showed a lot of anxiety and resentment. This study tends to detect and analyze sentiment polarity and emotions demonstrated during the initial phase of the pandemic and the lockdown period employing natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques on Twitter posts. Deep long short-term memory (LSTM) models used for estimating the sentiment polarity and emotions from extracted tweets have been trained to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the sentiment140 dataset. The use of emoticons showed a unique and novel way of validating the supervised deep learning models on tweets extracted from Twitter.	1622
Data monitoring committees for clinical trials evaluating treatments of  COVID-19	Tobias Mütze,Tim Friede	2020/08/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10992v1	ArXiv	The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in December 2019 and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. This sparked a plethora of investigations into diagnostics and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, as well as treatments for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with a high mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a data monitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB). DMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitment requiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use of complex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In this paper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspects of setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trials with more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs. Furthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding the presentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use of external data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulation study motivated by clinical trials in COVID-19.	1623
Impact on the Productivity of Remotely Working IT Professionals of  Bangladesh during the Coronavirus Disease 2019	Kishan Kumar Ganguly,Noshin Tahsin,Mridha Md. Nafis Fuad,Toukir Ahammed,Moumita Asad,Syed Fatiul Huq,A. T. M. Fazlay Rabbi,Kazi Sakib	2020/08/26			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11636v2	ArXiv	Similar to the rest of the world, the recent pandemic situation has forced the IT professionals of Bangladesh to adopt remote work. The aim of this study is to find out whether remote work can be continued even after the lockdown is lifted. As work from home may change various productivity related aspects of the employees, i.e., team dynamics and company dynamics, it is necessary to understand the nature of the change during WFH. Conducting a survey, we asked the IT professionals of Bangladesh how they perceive their level of productivity during WFH and how the factors related to productivity have changed. We analyzed the change and identified the areas affected by WFH. We discovered that resource and workspace related issues, emotional well-being of the employees have been hampered the most during WFH. We believe that the findings from this study will help to decide how to resolve those issues and will help to understand whether WFH can be continued even after the lockdown is lifted.	1624
New Normal: Cooperative Paradigm for Covid-19 Timely Detection and  Containment using Internet of Things and Deep Learning	Farooque Hassan Kumbhar,Syed Ali Hassan,Soo Young Shin	2020/08/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12103v1	ArXiv	The spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused trillions of dollars in damages to the governments and health authorities by affecting the global economies. The purpose of this study is to introduce a connected smart paradigm that not only detects the possible spread of viruses but also helps to restart businesses/economies, and resume social life. We are proposing a connected Internet of Things ( IoT) based paradigm that makes use of object detection based on convolution neural networks (CNN), smart wearable and connected e-health to avoid current and future outbreaks. First, connected surveillance cameras feed continuous video stream to the server where we detect the inter-object distance to identify any social distancing violations. A violation activates area-based monitoring of active smartphone users and their current state of illness. In case a confirmed patient or a person with high symptoms is present, the system tracks exposed and infected people and appropriate measures are put into actions. We evaluated the proposed scheme for social distancing violation detection using YOLO (you only look once) v2 and v3, and for infection spread tracing using Python simulation.	1625
Repurposing TREC-COVID Annotations to Answer the Key Questions of  CORD-19	Connor T. Heaton,Prasenjit Mitra	2020/08/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12353v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and to date has infected over 14M people worldwide, resulting in over 750,000 deaths. On March 10, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global pandemic. Many academics and researchers, not restricted to the medical domain, began publishing papers describing new discoveries. However, with the large influx of publications, it was hard for these individuals to sift through the large amount of data and make sense of the findings. The White House and a group of industry research labs, lead by the Allen Institute for AI, aggregated over 200,000 journal articles related to a variety of coronaviruses and tasked the community with answering key questions related to the corpus, releasing the dataset as CORD-19. The information retrieval (IR) community repurposed the journal articles within CORD-19 to more closely resemble a classic TREC-style competition, dubbed TREC-COVID, with human annotators providing relevancy judgements at the end of each round of competition. Seeing the related endeavors, we set out to repurpose the relevancy annotations for TREC-COVID tasks to identify journal articles in CORD-19 which are relevant to the key questions posed by CORD-19. A BioBERT model trained on this repurposed dataset prescribes relevancy annotations for CORD-19 tasks that have an overall agreement of 0.4430 with majority human annotations in terms of Cohen's kappa. We present the methodology used to construct the new dataset and describe the decision process used throughout.	1626
Automatic Deep Learning System for COVID-19 Infection Quantification in  chest CT	Omar Ibrahim Alirr	2020/10/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01982v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease spread globally and infected millions of people quickly, causing high pressure on the health-system facilities. PCR screening is the adopted diagnostic testing method for COVID-19 detection. However, PCR is criticized due its low sensitivity ratios, also, it is time-consuming and manual complicated process. CT imaging proved its ability to detect the disease even for asymptotic patients, which make it a trustworthy alternative for PCR. In addition, the appearance of COVID-19 infections in CT slices, offers high potential to support in disease evolution monitoring using automated infection segmentation methods. However, COVID-19 infection areas include high variations in term of size, shape, contrast and intensity homogeneity, which impose a big challenge on segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 infection areas segmentation. The system include different steps to enhance and improve infection areas appearance in the CT slices so they can be learned efficiently using the deep network. The system start prepare the region of interest by segmenting the lung organ, which then undergo edge enhancing diffusion filtering (EED) to improve the infection areas contrast and intensity homogeneity. The proposed FCN is implemented using U-net architecture with modified residual block with concatenation skip connection. The block improves the learning of gradient values by forwarding the infection area features through the network. To demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of the proposed system, it is trained and tested using many 2D CT slices extracted from diverse datasets from different sources. The proposed system is evaluated using different measures and achieved dice overlapping score of 0.961 and 0.780 for lung and infection areas segmentation, respectively.	1627
Publication Patterns' Changes due to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A  longitudinal and short-term scientometric analysis	Shir Aviv-Reuven,Ariel Rosenfeld	2020/10/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02594v2	ArXiv	In recent months the COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus) pandemic has spread throughout the world. In parallel, extensive scholarly research regarding various aspects of the pandemic has been published. In this work, we analyse the changes in biomedical publishing patterns due to the pandemic. We study the changes in the volume of publications in both peer reviewed journals and preprint servers, average time to acceptance of papers submitted to biomedical journals, international (co-)authorship of these papers (expressed by diversity and volume), and the possible association between journal metrics and said changes. We study these possible changes using two approaches: a short-term analysis through which changes during the first six months of the outbreak are examined for both COVID-19 related papers and non-COVID-19 related papers; and a longitudinal approach through which changes are examined in comparison to the previous four years. Our results show that the pandemic has so far had a tremendous effect on all examined accounts of scholarly publications: A sharp increase in publication volume has been witnessed and it can be almost entirely attributed to the pandemic; a significantly faster mean time to acceptance for COVID-19 papers is apparent, and it has (partially) come at the expense of non-COVID-19 papers; and a significant reduction in international collaboration for COVID-19 papers has also been identified. As the pandemic continues to spread, these changes may cause a slow down in research in non-COVID-19 biomedical fields and bring about a lower rate of international collaboration.	1628
Spatial-temporal Analysis of COVID-19's Impact on Human Mobility: the  Case of the United States	Songhe Wang,Kangda Wei,Lei Lin,Weizi Li	2020/10/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03707v2	ArXiv	COVID-19 has been affecting every aspect of societal life including human mobility since December, 2019. In this paper, we study the impact of COVID-19 on human mobility patterns at the state level within the United States. From the temporal perspective, we find that the change of mobility patterns does not necessarily correlate with government policies and guidelines, but is more related to people's awareness of the pandemic, which is reflected by the search data from Google Trends. Our results show that it takes on average 14 days for the mobility patterns to adjust to the new situation. From the spatial perspective, we conduct a state-level network analysis and clustering using the mobility data from Multiscale Dynamic Human Mobility Flow Dataset. As a result, we find that 1) states in the same cluster have shorter geographical distances; 2) a 14-day delay again is found between the time when the largest number of clusters appears and the peak of Coronavirus-related search queries on Google Trends; and 3) a major reduction in other network flow properties, namely degree, closeness, and betweenness, of all states from the week of March 2 to the week of April 6 (the week of the largest number of clusters).	1629
Nowcasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases: Foundations, trends, and  challenges	Tanujit Chakraborty,Indrajit Ghosh,Tirna Mahajan,Tejasvi Arora	2020/10/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05079v1	ArXiv	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. As of September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data. Still, forecasters' predictions are useful for the effective allocation of healthcare resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.	1630
Modelling Memory for Individual Re-identification in Decentralised  Mobile Contact Tracing Applications	Luca Bedogni,Shakila Khan Rumi,Flora Salim	2020/10/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05514v2	ArXiv	In 2020 the coronavirus outbreak changed the lives of people worldwide. After an initial time period in which it was unclear how to battle the virus, social distancing has been recognised globally as an effective method to mitigate the disease spread. This called for technological tools such as Mobile Contact Tracing Applications (MCTA), which are used to digitally trace contacts among people, and in case a positive case is found, people with the application installed which had been in contact will be notified. De-centralised MCTA may suffer from a novel kind of privacy attack, based on the memory of the human beings, which upon notification of the application can identify who is the positive individual responsible for the notification. Our results show that it is indeed possible to identify positive people among the group of contacts of a human being, and this is even easier when the sociability of the positive individual is low. In practice, our simulation results show that identification can be made with an accuracy of more than 90% depending on the scenario. We also provide three mitigation strategies which can be implemented in de-centralised MCTA and analyse which of the three are more effective in limiting this novel kind of attack.	1631
Multi-Level Group Testing with Application to One-Shot Pooled COVID-19  Tests	Amit Solomon,Alejandro Cohen,Nir Shlezinger,Yonina C. Eldar,Muriel Médard	2020/10/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06072v2	ArXiv	A key requirement in containing contagious diseases, such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is the ability to efficiently carry out mass diagnosis over large populations. Some of the leading testing procedures, such as those utilizing qualitative polymerase chain reaction, involve using dedicated machinery which can simultaneously process a limited amount of samples. A candidate method to increase the test throughput is to examine pooled samples comprised of a mixture of samples from different patients. In this work we study pooling based tests which operate in a one-shot fashion, while providing an indication not solely on the presence of infection, but also on its level, without additional pool tests, as often required in COVID-19 testing. As these requirements limit the application of traditional group-testing (GT) methods, we propose a multi-level GT scheme, which builds upon GT principles to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than patients, while operating in a one-shot manner and providing multi-level indications. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme and characterize conditions under which the algorithm operates reliably and at affordable computational complexity. Our numerical results demonstrate that multi level GT accurately and efficiently detects infection levels, while achieving improved performance over previously proposed one-shot COVID-19 pooled-testing methods.	1632
Face Mask Assistant: Detection of Face Mask Service Stage Based on  Mobile Phone	Yuzhen Chen,Menghan Hu,Chunjun Hua,Guangtao Zhai,Jian Zhang,Qingli Li,Simon X. Yang	2020/10/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06421v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world since it broke out massively in December 2019, which has caused a large loss to the whole world. Both the confirmed cases and death cases have reached a relatively frightening number. Syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, can be transmitted by small respiratory droplets. To curb its spread at the source, wearing masks is a convenient and effective measure. In most cases, people use face masks in a high-frequent but short-time way. Aimed at solving the problem that we don't know which service stage of the mask belongs to, we propose a detection system based on the mobile phone. We first extract four features from the GLCMs of the face mask's micro-photos. Next, a three-result detection system is accomplished by using KNN algorithm. The results of validation experiments show that our system can reach a precision of 82.87% (standard deviation=8.5%) on the testing dataset. In future work, we plan to expand the detection objects to more mask types. This work demonstrates that the proposed mobile microscope system can be used as an assistant for face mask being used, which may play a positive role in fighting against COVID-19.	1633
Combining detection and reconstruction of correlational and  quasi-periodic motifs in viral genomic sequences with transitional genome  mapping: Application to COVID-19	Vladimr R. Chechetkin,Vasily V. Lobzin	2020/10/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07006v4	ArXiv	A method of Transitional Automorphic Mapping of the Genome on Itself (TAMGI) is aimed at combining detection and reconstruction of correlational and quasi-periodic motifs in the viral genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The motifs reconstructed by TAMGI are robust with respect to indels and point mutations and can be tried as putative therapeutic targets. We developed and tested the relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of motifs in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic) packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is transported into spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of viruses with icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage PHIX174. A part of the quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences. Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for the study of numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats, the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory elements, data mining, and correlations in the genomic sequences.	1634
Vehicular Networks for Combating a Worldwide Pandemic: Preventing the  Spread of COVID-19	Ahmet M. Elbir,Gokhan Gurbilek,Burak Soner,Anastasios K. Papazafeiropoulos,Pandelis Kourtessis,Sinem Coleri	2020/10/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07602v4	ArXiv	As a worldwide pandemic, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused serious restrictions in people's social life, along with the loss of lives, the collapse of economies and the disruption of humanitarian aids. Despite the advance of technological developments, we, as researchers, have witnessed that several issues need further investigation for a better response to a pandemic outbreak. Therefore, researchers recently started developing ideas to stop or at least reduce the spread of the pandemic. While there have been some prior works on wireless networks for combating a pandemic scenario, vehicular networks and their potential bottlenecks have not yet been fully examined. Furthermore, the vehicular scenarios can be identified as the locations, where the social distancing is mostly violated. With this motivation, this article provides an extensive discussion on vehicular networking for combating a pandemic. We provide the major applications of vehicular networking for combating COVID-19 in public transportation, in-vehicle diagnosis, border patrol and social distance monitoring. Next, we identify the unique characteristics of the collected data in terms of privacy, flexibility and coverage, then highlight corresponding future directions in privacy preservation, resource allocation, data caching and data routing. We believe that this work paves the way for the development of new products and algorithms that can facilitate the social life and help controlling the spread of the pandemic.	1635
Understanding the Hoarding Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic using  Large Scale Social Media Data	Xupin Zhang,Hanjia Lyu,Jiebo Luo	2020/10/15			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07845v2	ArXiv	The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives around the world on an unprecedented scale. We intend to investigate hoarding behaviors in response to the pandemic using large-scale social media data. First, we collect hoarding-related tweets shortly after the outbreak of the coronavirus. Next, we analyze the hoarding and anti-hoarding patterns of over 42,000 unique Twitter users in the United States from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and dissect the hoarding-related tweets by age, gender, and geographic location. We find the percentage of females in both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than that of the general Twitter user population. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we investigate the opinions expressed towards the hoarding behavior by categorizing these topics according to demographic and geographic groups. We also calculate the anxiety scores for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related tweets using a lexical approach. By comparing their anxiety scores with the baseline Twitter anxiety score, we reveal further insights. The LIWC anxiety mean for the hoarding-related tweets is significantly higher than the baseline Twitter anxiety mean. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated anxiety score compared to other hoarded items mentioned in the tweets.	1636
Pinball-OCSVM for early-stage COVID-19 diagnosis with limited  posteroanterior chest X-ray images	Sanjay Kumar Sonbhadra,Sonali Agarwal,P. Nagabhushan	2020/10/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08115v2	ArXiv	The infection of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starts with the upper respiratory tract and as the virus grows, the infection can progress to lungs and develop pneumonia. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive during early stages; especially if the patient is asymptomatic, which may further cause more severe pneumonia. In this context, several deep learning models have been proposed to identify pulmonary infections using publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for early diagnosis, better treatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of COVID-19 positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises the challenge for unbiased learning of deep learning models. All deep learning models opted class balancing techniques to solve this issue; which however should be avoided in any medical diagnosis process. Moreover, the deep learning models are also data hungry and need massive computation resources. Therefore for quicker diagnosis, this research proposes a novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine (PB-OCSVM), that can work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency and to minimize the false predictions. The performance of the proposed model is compared with conventional OCSVM and existing deep learning models, and the experimental results prove that the proposed model outperformed over state-of-the-art methods. To validate the robustness of the proposed model, experiments are also performed with noisy CXR images and UCI benchmark datasets.	1637
The Role of Robotics in Infectious Disease Crises	Gregory Hager,Vijay Kumar,Robin Murphy,Daniela Rus,Russell Taylor	2020/10/19			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09909v1	ArXiv	The recent coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the many challenges faced by the healthcare, public safety, and economic systems when confronted with a surge in patients that require intensive treatment and a population that must be quarantined or shelter in place. The most obvious and pressing challenge is taking care of acutely ill patients while managing spread of infection within the care facility, but this is just the tip of the iceberg if we consider what could be done to prepare in advance for future pandemics. Beyond the obvious need for strengthening medical knowledge and preparedness, there is a complementary need to anticipate and address the engineering challenges associated with infectious disease emergencies. Robotic technologies are inherently programmable, and robotic systems have been adapted and deployed, to some extent, in the current crisis for such purposes as transport, logistics, and disinfection. As technical capabilities advance and as the installed base of robotic systems increases in the future, they could play a much more significant role in future crises. This report is the outcome of a virtual workshop co-hosted by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held on July 9-10, 2020. The workshop consisted of over forty participants including representatives from the engineering/robotics community, clinicians, critical care workers, public health and safety experts, and emergency responders. It identifies key challenges faced by healthcare responders and the general population and then identifies robotic/technological responses to these challenges. Then it identifies the key research/knowledge barriers that need to be addressed in developing effective, scalable solutions. Finally, the report ends with the following recommendations on how to implement this strategy.	1638
An Optimization-and-Simulation Framework for Redesigning University  Campus Bus System with Social Distancing	Gongyu Chen,Xinyu Fei,Huiwen Jia,Xian Yu,Siqian Shen	2020/10/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10630v3	ArXiv	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to significant challenges for schools, workplaces and communities to return to operations during the pandemic, requiring policymakers to balance individuals' safety and operational efficiency. In this paper, we present our work using mixed-integer programming and simulation for redesigning routes and bus schedules for University of Michigan (UM)'s campus bus system during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a hub-and-spoke design and utilize real data of student activities to identify hub locations and bus stops to be used in the new routes. Using the same total number of buses to operate, each new bus route has 50\% or fewer seats being used and takes maximumly 15 minutes, to reduce disease transmission through expiratory aerosol. We sample a variety of scenarios that cover variations of peak demand, social-distancing requirements, and break-down buses, to demonstrate the system resiliency of the new routes and schedules via simulation. The new bus routes are implemented and used by all UM campuses during the academic year 2020-2021, to ensure social distancing and short travel time. Our approach can be generalized to redesign public transit systems with social distancing requirement during the pandemic to reduce passengers' infection risk.	1639
Tele-operative Robotic Lung Ultrasound Scanning Platform for Triage of  COVID-19 Patients	Ryosuke Tsumura,John W. Hardin,Keshav Bimbraw,Olushola S. Odusanya,Yihao Zheng,Jeffrey C. Hill,Beatrice Hoffmann,Winston Soboyejo,Haichong K. Zhang	2020/10/23			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12335v3	ArXiv	Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic of epic proportions and a global response to prepare health systems worldwide is of utmost importance. In addition to its cost-effectiveness in a resources-limited setting, lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a rapid noninvasive imaging tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients. Concerns surrounding LUS include the disparity of infected patients and healthcare providers, relatively small number of physicians and sonographers capable of performing LUS, and most importantly, the requirement for substantial physical contact between the patient and operator, increasing the risk of transmission. Mitigation of the spread of the virus is of paramount importance. A 2-dimensional (2D) tele-operative robotic platform capable of performing LUS in for COVID-19 infected patients may be of significant benefit. The authors address the aforementioned issues surrounding the use of LUS in the application of COVID- 19 infected patients. In addition, first time application, feasibility and safety were validated in three healthy subjects, along with 2D image optimization and comparison for overall accuracy. Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed platform allows for successful acquisition and application of LUS in humans.	1640
The motion of respiratory droplets produced by coughing	Hongping Wang,Zhaobin Li,Xinlei Zhang,Lixing Zhu,Yi Liu,Shizhao Wang	2020/10/24			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12781v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic infectious respiratory disease with high mortality and infectiousness. This paper investigates respiratory droplet transmission, which is critical to understanding, modeling and controlling epidemics. In the present work, we implemented flow visualization, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle shadow tracking velocimetry (PSTV) to measure the velocity of the airflow and droplets involved in coughing and then constructed a physical model considering the evaporation effect to predict the motion of droplets under different weather conditions. The experimental results indicate that the convection velocity of cough airflow presents the relationship $t^{-0.7}$ with time; hence, the distance from the cougher increases by $t^{0.3}$ in the range of our measurement domain. Substituting these experimental results into the physical model reveals that the small droplets (initial diameter $D \leq$ 100 $\mu$m) evaporate to droplet nuclei and that the large droplets with $D \geq$ 500 $\mu$m and initial velocity $u_0 \geq$ 5 m/s travel more than 2 m. Winter conditions of low temperature and high relative humidity can cause more droplets to settle to the ground, which may be a possible driver of a second pandemic wave in the autumn and winter seasons.	1641
Triple-view Convolutional Neural Networks for COVID-19 Diagnosis with  Chest X-ray	Jianjia Zhang	2020/10/27			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14091v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting increasingly large number of people worldwide, posing significant stress to the health care systems. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical in screening of infected patients and breaking the person-to-person transmission. Chest X-ray (CXR) based computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 using deep learning becomes a promising solution to this end. However, the diverse and various radiographic features of COVID-19 make it challenging, especially when considering each CXR scan typically only generates one single image. Data scarcity is another issue since collecting large-scale medical CXR data set could be difficult at present. Therefore, how to extract more informative and relevant features from the limited samples available becomes essential. To address these issues, unlike traditional methods processing each CXR image from a single view, this paper proposes triple-view convolutional neural networks for COVID-19 diagnosis with CXR images. Specifically, the proposed networks extract individual features from three views of each CXR image, i.e., the left lung view, the right lung view and the overall view, in three streams and then integrate them for joint diagnosis. The proposed network structure respects the anatomical structure of human lungs and is well aligned with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in practice. In addition, the labeling of the views does not require experts' domain knowledge, which is needed by many existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in the more challenging three class classification task, and admits wide generality and high flexibility.	1642
A stochastic time-delayed model for the effectiveness of Moroccan  COVID-19 deconfinement strategy	Houssine Zine,Adnane Boukhouima,El Mehdi Lotfi,Marouane Mahrouf,Delfim F. M. Torres,Noura Yousfi	2020/10/28			http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16265v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health and the economy worldwide. Currently, COVID-19 evolves in many countries to a second stage, characterized by the need for the liberation of the economy and relaxation of the human psychological effects. To this end, numerous countries decided to implement adequate deconfinement strategies. After the first prolongation of the established confinement, Morocco moves to the deconfinement stage on May 20, 2020. The relevant question concerns the impact on the COVID-19 propagation by considering an additional degree of realism related to stochastic noises due to the effectiveness level of the adapted measures. In this paper, we propose a delayed stochastic mathematical model to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco after the deconfinement. To ensure the well-posedness of the model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution. Based on the large number theorem for martingales, we discuss the extinction of the disease under an appropriate threshold parameter. Moreover, numerical simulations are performed in order to test the efficiency of the deconfinement strategies chosen by the Moroccan authorities to help the policy makers and public health administration to make suitable decisions in the near future.	1643
A Quantitative Framework for Establishing Low-risk Interdistrict Travel  Corridors during COVID-19	Raviraj Dave,Tushar Choudhari,Udit Bhatia,Avijit Maji	2020/10/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00267v1	ArXiv	Aspirations to slow down the spread of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) resulted in unprecedented restrictions on personal and work-related travels in various nations across the globe. As a consequence, economic activities within and across the countries were almost halted. As restrictions loosen and cities start to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes critical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing pandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the commute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by combining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment with transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the proposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and across Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many SARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing the travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health vulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks due to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while the resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's districts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the overall travel risk. Our study provides actionable insights to users into choosing the alternate path with the least risk and can inform political decisions to establish low-risk travel corridors within and across the states while accounting for social and health vulnerabilities in addition to transit-time related risks.	1644
Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Mine Issues on Twitter During  the COVID-19 Pandemic	Ankita Agarwal,Preetham Salehundam,Swati Padhee,William L. Romine,Tanvi Banerjee	2020/10/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00377v2	ArXiv	The recent global outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread to all corners of the globe. The international travel ban, panic buying, and the need for self-quarantine are among the many other social challenges brought about in this new era. Twitter platforms have been used in various public health studies to identify public opinion about an event at the local and global scale. To understand the public concerns and responses to the pandemic, a system that can leverage machine learning techniques to filter out irrelevant tweets and identify the important topics of discussion on social media platforms like Twitter is needed. In this study, we constructed a system to identify the relevant tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2020, and explored topic modeling to identify the most discussed topics and themes during this period in our data set. Additionally, we analyzed the temporal changes in the topics with respect to the events that occurred during this pandemic. We found out that eight topics were sufficient to identify the themes in our corpus. These topics depicted a temporal trend. The dominant topics vary over time and align with the events related to the COVID-19 pandemic.	1645
Bifurcated Autoencoder for Segmentation of COVID-19 Infected Regions in  CT Images	Parham Yazdekhasty,Ali Zindar,Zahra Nabizadeh-ShahreBabak,Roshank Roshandel,Pejman Khadivi,Nader Karimi,Shadrokh Samavi	2020/11/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00631v1	ArXiv	The new coronavirus infection has shocked the world since early 2020 with its aggressive outbreak. Rapid detection of the disease saves lives, and relying on medical imaging (Computed Tomography and X-ray) to detect infected lungs has shown to be effective. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been used for image analysis in this context. However, accurate identification of infected regions has proven challenging for two main reasons. Firstly, the characteristics of infected areas differ in different images. Secondly, insufficient training data makes it challenging to train various machine learning algorithms, including deep-learning models. This paper proposes an approach to segment lung regions infected by COVID-19 to help cardiologists diagnose the disease more accurately, faster, and more manageable. We propose a bifurcated 2-D model for two types of segmentation. This model uses a shared encoder and a bifurcated connection to two separate decoders. One decoder is for segmentation of the healthy region of the lungs, while the other is for the segmentation of the infected regions. Experiments on publically available images show that the bifurcated structure segments infected regions of the lungs better than state of the art.	1646
An ontology-based chatbot for crises management: use case coronavirus	Khouloud Hwerbi	2020/11/02			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02340v1	ArXiv	"Today is the era of intelligence in machines. With the advances in Artificial Intelligence, machines have started to impersonate different human traits, a chatbot is the next big thing in the domain of conversational services. A chatbot is a virtual person who is capable to carry out a natural conversation with people. They can include skills that enable them to converse with the humans in audio, visual, or textual formats. Artificial intelligence conversational entities, also called chatbots, conversational agents, or dialogue system, are an excellent example of such machines. Obtaining the right information at the right time and place is the key to effective disaster management. The term ""disaster management"" encompasses both natural and human-caused disasters. To assist citizens, our project is to create a COVID Assistant to provide the need of up to date information to be available 24 hours. With the growth in the World Wide Web, it is quite intelligible that users are interested in the swift and relatedly correct information for their hunt. A chatbot can be seen as a question-and-answer system in which experts provide knowledge to solicit users. This master thesis is dedicated to discuss COVID Assistant chatbot and explain each component in detail. The design of the proposed chatbot is introduced by its seven components: Ontology, Web Scraping module, DB, State Machine, keyword Extractor, Trained chatbot, and User Interface."	1647
Fluid dynamics simulations show that facial masks can suppress the  spread of COVID-19 in indoor environments	Ali Khosronejad,Christian Santoni,Kevin Flora,Zexia Zhang,Seokkoo Kang,Seyedmehdi Payabvash,Fotis Sotiropoulos	2020/11/06			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03394v1	ArXiv	The Coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 has been causing significant loss of life and unprecedented economical loss throughout the world. Social distancing and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks. Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow (indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect of human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical grade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging from 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with medical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus, in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial masks.	1648
Google Trends Analysis of COVID-19	Hoang Long Nguyen,Zhenhe Pan,Hashim Abu-gellban,Fang Jin,Yuanlin Zhang	2020/11/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03847v1	ArXiv	The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic disease on the 11th of March as there were 118K cases in several countries and territories. Numerous researchers worked on forecasting the number of confirmed cases since anticipating the growth of the cases helps governments adopting knotty decisions to ease the lockdowns orders for their countries. These orders help several people who have lost their jobs and support gravely impacted businesses. Our research aims to investigate the relation between Google search trends and the spreading of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) over countries worldwide, to predict the number of cases. We perform a correlation analysis on the keywords of the related Google search trends according to the number of confirmed cases reported by the WHO. After that, we applied several machine learning techniques (Multiple Linear Regression, Non-negative Integer Regression, Deep Neural Network), to forecast the number of confirmed cases globally based on historical data as well as the hybrid data (Google search trends). Our results show that Google search trends are highly associated with the number of reported confirmed cases, where the Deep Learning approach outperforms other forecasting techniques. We believe that it is not only a promising approach for forecasting the confirmed cases of COVID-19, but also for similar forecasting problems that are associated with the related Google trends.	1649
Molecular Communication Theoretical Modeling and Analysis of SARS-CoV2  Transmission in Human Respiratory System	Caglar Koca,Meltem Civas,Selin M. Sahin,Onder Ergonul,Ozgur B. Akan	2020/11/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05154v2	ArXiv	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) caused the ongoing pandemic. This pandemic devastated the world by killing more than a million people, as of October 2020. It is imperative to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV2 so that novel and interdisciplinary prevention, diagnostic, and therapeutic techniques could be developed. In this work, we model and analyze the transmission of SARS-CoV2 through the human respiratory tract from a molecular communication perspective. We consider that virus diffusion occurs in the mucus layer so that the shape of the tract does not have a significant effect on the transmission. Hence, this model reduces the inherent complexity of the human respiratory system. We further provide the impulse response of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 receptor binding event to determine the proportion of the virus population reaching different regions of the respiratory tract. Our findings confirm the results in the experimental literature on higher mucus flow rate causing virus migration to the lower respiratory tract. These results are especially important to understand the effect of SARS-CoV2 on the different human populations at different ages who have different mucus flow rates and ACE2 receptor concentrations in the different regions of the respiratory tract.	1650
Classification of COVID-19 in Chest CT Images using Convolutional  Support Vector Machines	Umut Özkaya,Şaban Öztürk,Serkan Budak,Farid Melgani,Kemal Polat	2020/11/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05746v1	ArXiv	Purpose: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China and affected the whole world, has cost the lives of thousands of people. Manual diagnosis is inefficient due to the rapid spread of this virus. For this reason, automatic COVID-19 detection studies are carried out with the support of artificial intelligence algorithms. Methods: In this study, a deep learning model that detects COVID-19 cases with high performance is presented. The proposed method is defined as Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and can automatically classify Computed Tomography (CT) images. Unlike the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained with the transfer learning method, the CSVM model is trained as a scratch. To evaluate the performance of the CSVM method, the dataset is divided into two parts as training (%75) and testing (%25). The CSVM model consists of blocks containing three different numbers of SVM kernels. Results: When the performance of pre-trained CNN networks and CSVM models is assessed, CSVM (7x7, 3x3, 1x1) model shows the highest performance with 94.03% ACC, 96.09% SEN, 92.01% SPE, 92.19% PRE, 94.10% F1-Score, 88.15% MCC and 88.07% Kappa metric values. Conclusion: The proposed method is more effective than other methods. It has proven in experiments performed to be an inspiration for combating COVID and for future studies.	1651
Social Distancing and COVID-19: Randomization Inference for a Structured  Dose-Response Relationship	Bo Zhang,Siyu Heng,Ting Ye,Dylan S. Small	2020/11/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06917v3	ArXiv	Social distancing is widely acknowledged as an effective public health policy combating the novel coronavirus. But extreme social distancing has costs and it is not clear how much social distancing is needed to achieve public health effects. In this article, we develop a design-based framework to make inference about the dose-response relationship between social distancing and COVID-19 related death toll and case numbers. We first discuss how to embed observational data with a time-independent, continuous treatment dose into an approximate randomized experiment, and develop a randomization-based procedure that tests if a structured dose-response relationship fits the data. We then generalize the design and testing procedure to accommodate a time-dependent, treatment dose trajectory, and generalize a dose-response relationship to a longitudinal setting. Finally, we apply the proposed design and testing procedures to investigate the effect of social distancing during the phased reopening in the United States on public health outcomes using data compiled from sources including Unacast, the United States Census Bureau, and the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program. We rejected a primary analysis null hypothesis that stated the social distancing from April 27, 2020, to June 28, 2020, had no effect on the COVID-19-related death toll from June 29, 2020, to August 2, 2020 (p-value < 0.001), and found that it took more reduction in mobility to prevent exponential growth in case numbers for non-rural counties compared to rural counties.	1652
Classification based on invisible features and thereby finding the  effect of tuberculosis vaccine on COVID-19	Nihal Acharya Adde,Thilo Moshagen	2020/11/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07332v1	ArXiv	In the case of clustered data, an artificial neural network with logcosh loss function learns the bigger cluster rather than the mean of the two. Even more so, the ANN when used for regression of a set-valued function, will learn a value close to one of the choices, in other words, it learns one branch of the set-valued function with high accuracy. This work suggests a method that uses artificial neural networks with logcosh loss to find the branches of set-valued mappings in parameter-outcome sample sets and classifies the samples according to those branches. The method not only classifies the data based on these branches but also provides an accurate prediction for the majority cluster. The method successfully classifies the data based on an invisible feature. A neural network was successfully established to predict the total number of cases, the logarithmic total number of cases, deaths, active cases and other relevant data of the coronavirus for each German district from a number of input variables. As it has been speculated that the Tuberculosis vaccine provides protection against the virus and since East Germany was vaccinated before reunification, an attempt was made to classify the Eastern and Western German districts by considering the vaccine information as an invisible feature.	1653
Phenomenological description of spread of Covid-19 in Italy: people  mobility as main factor controlling propagation of infection cases	Corrado Spinella,Antonio Massimiliano Mio	2020/11/16			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08111v2	ArXiv	The spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), starting in late 2019, has determined in Italy several interventions aimed to prevent saturation of the health system. We have examined the effects of such measures by proposing a mean-field model describing the spread of the infection based on a simple diffusion process where all the observable variables (number of people still positive to the infection, hospitalized and fatalities cases, healed people, and total number of people that has contracted the infection) depend on average parameters, namely diffusion coefficient, infection cross-section, and population density. Although this model is less sophisticated than other models in the literature, it allows us to directly relate the trend of the epidemic statistical information (hospitalized cases, number of fatalities, number of infected people, etc.) to a well defined observable physical quantity: the average number of people that any individual meets per day. The model fits very well the epidemic data, and allows us to strictly relate the time evolution of the number of hospitalized case and fatalities of the outbreak to the change of people mobility, consequent to the implementation of progressive restrictions in Italy, running until the present days (November the 15th, 2020).	1654
Political Partisanship and Anti-Science Attitudes in Online Discussions  about Covid-19	Ashwin Rao,Fred Morstatter,Minda Hu,Emily Chen,Keith Burghardt,Emilio Ferrara,Kristina Lerman	2020/11/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08498v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage communities across the US. Opinion surveys identified importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. Here, we use social media data to study complexity of polarization. We analyze a large dataset of tweets related to the pandemic collected between January and May of 2020, and develop methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative) and science (anti-science vs pro-science) dimensions. While polarization along the science and political dimensions are correlated, politically moderate users are more likely to be aligned with the pro-science views, and politically hardline users with anti-science views. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that polarization grows over time; instead, we see increasing activity by moderate pro-science users. We also show that anti-science conservatives tend to tweet from the Southern US, while anti-science moderates from the Western states. Our findings shed light on the multi-dimensional nature of polarization, and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.	1655
Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals key epigenetic targets in  SARS-CoV-2 infection	Marisol Salgado-Albarran,Erick I. Navarro-Delgado,Aylin Del Moral-Morales,Nicolas Alcaraz,Jan Baumbach,Rodrigo Gonzalez-Barrios,Ernesto Soto-Reyes	2020/11/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08902v1	ArXiv	COVID-19 is an infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2), which has caused a global outbreak. Current research efforts are focused on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to propose drug-based therapeutic options. Transcriptional changes due to epigenetic regulation are key host cell responses to viral infection and have been studied in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; however, such changes are not fully described for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed multiple transcriptomes obtained from cell lines infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and from COVID-19 patient-derived samples. Using integrative analyses of gene co-expression networks and de-novo pathway enrichment, we characterize different gene modules and protein pathways enriched with Transcription Factors or Epifactors relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified EP300, MOV10, RELA and TRIM25 as top candidates, and more than 60 additional proteins involved in the epigenetic response during viral infection that have therapeutic potential. Our results show that targeting the epigenetic machinery could be a feasible alternative to treat COVID-19.	1656
Spatiotemporal Differences of COVID-19 Infection among Healthcare  Workers and Patients in China from January to March 2020	Peixiao Wang,Xinyan Zhu,Wei Guo,Hui Ren,Tao Hu	2020/11/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09342v2	ArXiv	Studying the spatiotemporal differences in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) between social groups such as healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients can aid in formulating epidemic containment policies. Most previous studies of the spatiotemporal characteristics of COVID-19 were conducted in a single group and did not explore the differences between groups. To fill this research gap, this study assessed the spatiotemporal characteristics and differences among patients and HCWs infection in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and China (excluding Hubei). The temporal difference was greater in Wuhan than in the rest of Hubei, and was greater in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) than in the rest of China. The incidence was high in healthcare workers in the early stages of the epidemic. Therefore, it is important to strengthen the protective measures for healthcare workers in the early stage of the epidemic. The spatial difference was less in Wuhan than in the rest of Hubei, and less in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) than in the rest of China. The spatial distribution of healthcare worker infections can be used to infer the spatial distribution of the epidemic in the early stage and to formulate control measures accordingly.	1657
A Deep Language-independent Network to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on  the World via Sentiment Analysis	Ashima Yadav,Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma	2020/11/20			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10358v1	ArXiv	Towards the end of 2019, Wuhan experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus, which soon spread all over the world, resulting in a deadly pandemic that infected millions of people around the globe. The government and public health agencies followed many strategies to counter the fatal virus. However, the virus severely affected the social and economic lives of the people. In this paper, we extract and study the opinion of people from the top five worst affected countries by the virus, namely USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa. We propose a deep language-independent Multilevel Attention-based Conv-BiGRU network (MACBiG-Net), which includes embedding layer, word-level encoded attention, and sentence-level encoded attention mechanism to extract the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The embedding layer encodes the sentence sequence into a real-valued vector. The word-level and sentence-level encoding is performed by a 1D Conv-BiGRU based mechanism, followed by word-level and sentence-level attention, respectively. We further develop a COVID-19 Sentiment Dataset by crawling the tweets from Twitter. Extensive experiments on our proposed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MACBiG-Net. Also, attention-weights visualization and in-depth results analysis shows that the proposed network has effectively captured the sentiments of the people.	1658
Detection of COVID-19 Using Heart Rate and Blood Pressure: Lessons  Learned from Patients with ARDS	Milad Asgari Mehrabadi,Seyed Amir Hossein Aqajari,Iman Azimi,Charles A Downs,Nikil Dutt,Amir M Rahmani	2020/11/12			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10470v1	ArXiv	The world has been affected by COVID-19 coronavirus. At the time of this study, the number of infected people in the United States is the highest globally (7.9 million infections). Within the infected population, patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are in more life-threatening circumstances, resulting in severe respiratory system failure. Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by monitoring laboratory metrics and symptoms. Unfortunately, these methods are merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to early-detect different respiratory diseases in ubiquitous health monitoring. We posit that such biomarkers are informative in identifying ARDS patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the behavior of COVID-19 on ARDS patients by utilizing simple vital signs. We analyze the long-term daily logs of blood pressure and heart rate associated with 70 ARDS patients admitted to five University of California academic health centers (containing 42506 samples for each vital sign) to distinguish subjects with COVID-19 positive and negative test results. In addition to the statistical analysis, we develop a deep neural network model to extract features from the longitudinal data. Using only the first eight days of the data, our deep learning model is able to achieve 78.79% accuracy to classify the vital signs of ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 versus other ARDS diagnosed patients.	1659
Regional Impacts of COVID-19 on Carbon Dioxide Detected Worldwide from  Space	Brad Weir,David Crisp,Christopher W O'Dell,Sourish Basu,Abhishek Chatterjee,Jana Kolassa,Tomohiro Oda,Steven Pawson,Benjamin Poulter,Zhen Zhang,Philippe Ciais,Steven J Davis,Zhu Liu,Lesley E Ott	2020/11/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12740v2	ArXiv	Activity reductions in early 2020 due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic led to unprecedented decreases in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Despite their record size, the resulting atmospheric signals are smaller than and obscured by climate variability in atmospheric transport and biospheric fluxes, notably that related to the 2019-2020 Indian Ocean Dipole. Monitoring CO2 anomalies and distinguishing human and climatic causes thus remains a new frontier in Earth system science. We show, for the first time, that the impact of short-term, regional changes in fossil fuel emissions on CO2 concentrations was observable from space. Starting in February and continuing through May, column CO2 over many of the World's largest emitting regions was 0.14 to 0.62 parts per million less than expected in a pandemic-free scenario, consistent with reductions of 3 to 13 percent in annual, global emissions. Current spaceborne technologies are therefore approaching levels of accuracy and precision needed to support climate mitigation strategies with future missions expected to meet those needs.	1660
Machine learning spatio-temporal epidemiological model to evaluate  Germany-county-level COVID-19 risk	Lingxiao Wang,Tian Xu,Till Hannes Stoecker,Horst Stoecker,Yin Jiang,Kai Zhou	2020/11/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00082v1	ArXiv	As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, it is of critical significance to provide a timely risk prediction of the COVID-19 in multi-level. To implement it and evaluate the public health policies, we develop a framework with machine learning assisted to extract epidemic dynamics from the infection data, in which contains a county-level spatiotemporal epidemiological model that combines a spatial Cellular Automaton (CA) with a temporal Susceptible-Undiagnosed-Infected-Removed (SUIR) model. Compared with the existing time risk prediction models, the proposed CA-SUIR model shows the multi-level risk of the county to the government and coronavirus transmission patterns under different policies. This new toolbox is first utilized to the projection of the multi-level COVID-19 prevalence over 412 Landkreis (counties) in Germany, including t-day-ahead risk forecast and the risk assessment to the travel restriction policy. As a practical illustration, we predict the situation at Christmas where the worst fatalities are 34.5 thousand, effective policies could contain it to below 21 thousand. Such intervenable evaluation system could help decide on economic restarting and public health policies making in pandemic.	1661
Forecasting confirmed cases of the COVID-19 pandemic with a  migration-based epidemiological model	Xinyu Wang,Lu Yang,Hong Zhang,Zhouwang Yang,Catherine Liu	2020/12/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00397v1	ArXiv	The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a worldwide threat to human life since its invasion into the daily lives of the public in the first several months of 2020. Predicting the size of confirmed cases is important for countries and communities to make proper prevention and control policies so as to effectively curb the spread of COVID-19. Different from the 2003 SARS epidemic and the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, COVID-19 has unique epidemiological characteristics in its infectious and recovered compartments. This drives us to formulate a new infectious dynamic model for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic within the human mobility network, named the SaucIR-model in the sense that the new compartmental model extends the benchmark SIR model by dividing the flow of people in the infected state into asymptomatic, pathologically infected but unconfirmed, and confirmed. Furthermore, we employ dynamic modeling of population flow in the model in order that spatial effects can be incorporated effectively. We forecast the spread of accumulated confirmed cases in some provinces of mainland China and other countries that experienced severe infection during the time period from late February to early May 2020. The novelty of incorporating the geographic spread of the pandemic leads to a surprisingly good agreement with published confirmed case reports. The numerical analysis validates the high degree of predictability of our proposed SaucIR model compared to existing resemblance. The proposed forecasting SaucIR model is implemented in Python. A web-based application is also developed by Dash (under construction).	1662
Plasmonic metamaterial based virus detection system: a review	Mohammad Muntasir Hassan,Farhan Sadik Sium,Fariba Islam,Sajid Muhaimin Choudhury	2020/11/29			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00551v5	ArXiv	Our atmosphere is constantly changing and new pathogens are erupting now and then and the existing pathogens are mutating continuously. Some of these pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, become so deadly that they put the whole technological advancement of healthcare under challenge. Within this very decade several other deadly virus outbreaks were witnessed by humans such as Zika virus, Ebola virus, MERS-coronavirus etc. Though conventional techniques have succeeded in detecting these viruses to some extent, these techniques are time-consuming, costly, and require trained human-resources. Plasmonic metamaterial-based biosensors might pave the way to low-cost rapid virus detection. So this review discusses in details the latest development in plasmonics and metamaterial-based biosensors for virus, viral particles and antigen detection and the future direction of research in this field. Emergence of quantum properties in biosensing, application of machine learning, artificial intelligence and novel materials in biosensing is also discussed in brief.	1663
Modified Dorfman procedure for pool tests with dilution -- COVID-19 case  study	Andrzej Jaszkiewicz	2020/11/30			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00673v2	ArXiv	The outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic results in unprecedented demand for fast and efficient testing of large numbers of patients for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of individual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known and studied methods of this kind. This procedure is, however, based on unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a computational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of false negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests, especially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001 the number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests in the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the expected number of false negatives, respectively. This makes the proposed procedure an interesting choice for screening tests in the case of diseases like COVID-19.	1664
Multiscale Attention Guided Network for COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Chest  X-ray Images	Jingxiong Li,Yaqi Wang,Shuai Wang,Jun Wang,Jun Liu,Qun Jin,Lingling Sun	2020/11/11			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02278v2	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most destructive pandemic after millennium, forcing the world to tackle a health crisis. Automated lung infections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen diagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19 from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged disease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To address these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 from pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction vector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of trained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims at generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale attention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR image dataset. Plentiful experiments are proposed for MAG-SD which demonstrates its unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cutting-edge models. The code is available at https://github.com/JasonLeeGHub/MAG-SD.	1665
PCT-TEE: Trajectory-based Private Contact Tracing System with Trusted  Execution Environment	Fumiyuki Kato,Yang Cao,Masatoshi Yoshikawa	2020/12/07			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03782v5	ArXiv	"Existing Bluetooth-based Private Contact Tracing (PCT) systems can privately detect whether people have come into direct contact with COVID-19 patients. However, we find that the existing systems lack functionality and flexibility, which may hurt the success of the contact tracing. Specifically, they cannot detect indirect contact (e.g., people may be exposed to coronavirus because of used the same elevator even without direct contact); they also cannot flexibly change the rules of ""risky contact"", such as how many hours of exposure or how close to a COVID-19 patient that is considered as risk exposure, which may be changed with the environmental situation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure contact tracing system that enables both direct contact and indirect contact. To address the above problems, we need to utilize users' trajectory data for private contact tracing, which we call trajectory-based PCT. We formalize this problem as Spatiotemporal Private Set Intersection. By analyzing different approaches such as homomorphic encryption that could be extended to solve this problem, we identify that Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a proposing method to achieve our requirements. The major challenge is how to design algorithms for spatiotemporal private set intersection under limited secure memory of TEE. To this end, we design a TEE-based system with flexible trajectory data encoding algorithms. Our experiments on real-world data show that the proposed system can process thousands of queries on tens of million records of trajectory data in a few seconds."	1666
Discovering Airline-Specific Business Intelligence from Online Passenger  Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach	Sharan Srinivas,Surya Ramachandiran	2020/12/14			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08000v1	ArXiv	To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the passenger's perspective and tailor service offerings for competitive advantage, airlines can capitalize on the abundantly available online customer reviews (OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently, we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER), is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR. Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and predictions on similar pandemics in the future.	1667
The COVID-19 Infodemic: Twitter versus Facebook	Kai-Cheng Yang,Francesco Pierri,Pik-Mai Hui,David Axelrod,Christopher Torres-Lugo,John Bryden,Filippo Menczer	2020/12/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09353v2	ArXiv	"The global spread of the novel coronavirus is affected by the spread of related misinformation -- the so-called COVID-19 Infodemic -- that makes populations more vulnerable to the disease through resistance to mitigation efforts. Here we analyze the prevalence and diffusion of links to low-credibility content about the pandemic across two major social media platforms, Twitter and Facebook. We characterize cross-platform similarities and differences in popular sources, diffusion patterns, influencers, coordination, and automation. Comparing the two platforms, we find divergence among the prevalence of popular low-credibility sources and suspicious videos. A minority of accounts and pages exert a strong influence on each platform. These misinformation ""superspreaders"" are often associated with the low-credibility sources and tend to be verified by the platforms. On both platforms, there is evidence of coordinated sharing of Infodemic content. The overt nature of this manipulation points to the need for societal-level solutions in addition to mitigation strategies within the platforms. However, we highlight limits imposed by inconsistent data-access policies on our capability to study harmful manipulations of information ecosystems."	1668
Modelling a novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A stochastic SEIR-HCD  approach, with real-time parameter estimation & forecasting for Scotland	Jonathan Wells,Chris Robertson,Vincent Marmara,Alan Yeung,Adam Kleczkowski	2020/12/22			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12390v1	ArXiv	Faced with the 2020 SARS-CoV2 epidemic, public health officials have been seeking models that could be used to predict not only the number of new cases but also the levels of hospitalisation, critical care and deaths. In this paper we present a stochastic compartmental model capable of real-time monitoring and forecasting of the pandemic incorporating multiple streams of real-world data, reported cases, testing intensity, deaths, hospitalisations and critical care occupancy. Model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian particle filtering technique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases, critical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and September-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model hospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the recorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the Health Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were constant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the reproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase again from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over Summer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to provide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very good for the period from March to June 2020, even at early stages of the pandemic. The model has been slower to pick up the increase in the case numbers in September 2020 but forecasting improves again in the later stages of the epidemic.	1669
COVIDX: Computer-aided diagnosis of Covid-19 and its severity prediction  with raw digital chest X-ray images	Wajid Arshad Abbasi,Syed Ali Abbas,Saiqa Andleeb	2020/12/25			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13605v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) and it has infected and killed millions of people across the globe. In the absence of specific drugs or vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19 and the limitation of prevailing diagnostic techniques, there is a requirement for some alternate automatic screening systems that can be used by the physicians to quickly identify and isolate the infected patients. A chest X-ray (CXR) image can be used as an alternative modality to detect and diagnose the COVID-19. In this study, we present an automatic COVID-19 diagnostic and severity prediction (COVIDX) system that uses deep feature maps from CXR images to diagnose COVID-19 and its severity prediction. The proposed system uses a three-phase classification approach (healthy vs unhealthy, COVID-19 vs Pneumonia, and COVID-19 severity) using different shallow supervised classification algorithms. We evaluated COVIDX not only through 10-fold cross2 validation and by using an external validation dataset but also in real settings by involving an experienced radiologist. In all the evaluation settings, COVIDX outperforms all the existing stateof-the-art methods designed for this purpose. We made COVIDX easily accessible through a cloud-based webserver and python code available at https://sites.google.com/view/wajidarshad/software and https://github.com/wajidarshad/covidx, respectively.	1670
FGraDA: A Dataset and Benchmark for Fine-Grained Domain Adaptation in  Machine Translation	Wenhao Zhu,Shujian Huang,Tong Pu,Pingxuan Huang,Xu Zhang,Jian Yu,Wei Chen,Yanfeng Wang,Jiajun Chen	2020/12/31			http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15717v2	ArXiv	Previous research for adapting a general neural machine translation (NMT) model into a specific domain usually neglects the diversity in translation within the same domain, which is a core problem for domain adaptation in real-world scenarios. One representative of such challenging scenarios is to deploy a translation system for a conference with a specific topic, e.g., global warming or coronavirus, where there are usually extremely less resources due to the limited schedule. To motivate wider investigation in such a scenario, we present a real-world fine-grained domain adaptation task in machine translation (FGraDA). The FGraDA dataset consists of Chinese-English translation task for four sub-domains of information technology: autonomous vehicles, AI education, real-time networks, and smart phone. Each sub-domain is equipped with a development set and test set for evaluation purposes. To be closer to reality, FGraDA does not employ any in-domain bilingual training data but provides bilingual dictionaries and wiki knowledge base, which can be easier obtained within a short time. We benchmark the fine-grained domain adaptation task and present in-depth analyses showing that there are still challenging problems to further improve the performance with heterogeneous resources.	1671
Few-shot Learning for CT Scan based COVID-19 Diagnosis	Yifan Jiang,Han Chen,David K. Han,Hanseok Ko	2021/02/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00596v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern infecting more than 40 million people across 188 countries and territories. Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging technique benefits from its high diagnostic accuracy and robustness, it has become an indispensable way for COVID-19 mass testing. Recently, deep learning approaches have become an effective tool for automatic screening of medical images, and it is also being considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the high infection risk involved with COVID-19 leads to relative sparseness of collected labeled data limiting the performance of such methodologies. Moreover, accurately labeling CT images require expertise of radiologists making the process expensive and time-consuming. In order to tackle the above issues, we propose a supervised domain adaption based COVID-19 CT diagnostic method which can perform effectively when only a small samples of labeled CT scans are available. To compensate for the sparseness of labeled data, the proposed method utilizes a large amount of synthetic COVID-19 CT images and adjusts the networks from the source domain (synthetic data) to the target domain (real data) with a cross-domain training mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot COVID-19 CT imaging based diagnostic tasks.	1672
Human-Robot Interaction: Applications	Abdel-Nasser Sharkawy	2021/02/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00928v1	ArXiv	Recently, human-robot interaction (HRI) is an extensive research topic and theme which gained importance and significance. HRI aims at the complementary combination between the robot capabilities and human skills. The robots assist humans in terms of precision, speed, and force. The humans contribute in terms of the experience, knowledge of executing the task, intuition, and easy adaptation and learning, and understanding of control strategies. In this work, the applications of human-robot interaction are reviewed. These applications could be industrial, medical, agricultural, servical, and educational. HRI can be found in industrial applications in picking and placing in the production lines, welding processes, parts assembly, and painting. Assistive robotics are one from the highest profile areas in HRI. For people with the physical and the mental challenges, the robots can provide the opportunity of interaction and therapy. In addition, HRI can be widely applied in hospitals. Nowadays, HRI is very important for facing the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In agriculture, the cooperation between human and the robot helps with many tasks including harvesting, seeding, fertilizing, spraying, weed detection, hauling, and mowing. HRI can also be found in other applications such as education, mining, and home use.	1673
Blockchain for Decentralized Multi-Drone to Combat COVID-19	S. H. Alsamhi,B. Lee,M. Guizani,N. Kumar,Y. Qiao,Xuan Liu	2021/02/01			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00969v1	ArXiv	Currently, drones represent a promising technology for combating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the transport of goods, medical supplies to a given target location in the quarantine areas experiencing an epidemic outbreak. Drone missions will increasingly rely on drone collaboration, which requires the drones to reduce communication complexity and be controlled in a decentralized fashion. Blockchain technology becomes a must in industrial applications because it provides decentralized data, accessibility, immutability, and irreversibility. Therefore, Blockchain makes data public for all drones and enables drones to log information concerning world states, time, location, resources, delivery data, and drone relation to all neighbors drones. This paper introduces decentralized independent multi-drones to accomplish the task collaboratively. Improving blockchain with a consensus algorithm can improve network partitioning and scalability in order to combat COVID-19. The multi-drones task is to combat COVID-19 via monitoring and detecting, social distancing, sanitization, data analysis, delivering goods and medical supplies, and announcement while avoiding collisions with one another. We discuss End to End (E2E) delivery application of combination blockchain and multi-drone in combating COVID-19 and beyond future pandemics. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities of our proposed framework are highlighted.	1674
Dietary Supplements and Nutraceuticals Under Investigation for COVID-19  Prevention and Treatment	Ronan Lordan,Halie M. Rando,COVID-19 Review Consortium,Casey S. Greene	2021/02/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02250v1	ArXiv	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused global disruption and a significant loss of life. Existing treatments that can be repurposed as prophylactic and therapeutic agents could reduce the pandemic's devastation. Emerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has led to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for COVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical investigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based recommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant role in patient outcomes, and these products could help alleviate deficiencies. For example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing number of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D supplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin D and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the extent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in the COVID-19 crisis.	1675
Digital twins based on bidirectional LSTM and GAN for modelling the  COVID-19 pandemic	César Quilodrán-Casas,Vinicius Santos Silva,Rossella Arcucci,Claire E. Heaney,Yike Guo,Christopher C. Pain	2021/02/03			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02664v2	ArXiv	The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now spread throughout the globe infecting over 150 million people and causing the death of over 3.2 million people. Thus, there is an urgent need to study the dynamics of epidemiological models to gain a better understanding of how such diseases spread. While epidemiological models can be computationally expensive, recent advances in machine learning techniques have given rise to neural networks with the ability to learn and predict complex dynamics at reduced computational costs. Here we introduce two digital twins of a SEIRS model applied to an idealised town. The SEIRS model has been modified to take account of spatial variation and, where possible, the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK. We compare predictions from a data-corrected Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network and a predictive Generative Adversarial Network. The predictions given by these two frameworks are accurate when compared to the original SEIRS model data.   Additionally, these frameworks are data-agnostic and could be applied to towns, idealised or real, in the UK or in other countries. Also, more compartments could be included in the SEIRS model, in order to study more realistic epidemiological behaviour.	1676
Accurate Evaluation on the Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with Its Receptor  ACE2 and Antibodies CR3022/CB6	Hong-ming Ding,Yue-wen Yin,Song-di Ni,Yan-jing Sheng,Yu-qiang Ma	2021/01/17			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03305v1	ArXiv	The spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health crisis. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 (in particular the receptor binding domain, RBD) to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the antibodies is of great importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19 and evaluating the candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose a new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol, which agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol, respectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational alanine scanning method. The present study offers a computationally efficient and numerically reliable method to evaluate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 binding to other proteins, which may stimulate the development of the therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease in real applications.	1677
Cyber Risk in Health Facilities: A Systematic Literature Review	Alberto Sardi,Alessandro Rizzi,Enrico Sorano,Anna Guerrieri	2021/02/08			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04093v1	ArXiv	The current world challenges include issues such as infectious disease pandemics, environmental health risks, food safety, and crime prevention. Through this article, a special emphasis is given to one of the main challenges in the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, the cyber risk. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization has detected a dramatic increase in the number of cyber-attacks. For instance, in Italy the COVID-19 emergency has heavily affected cybersecurity; from January to April 2020, the total of attacks, accidents, and violations of privacy to the detriment of companies and individuals has doubled. Using a systematic and rigorous approach, this paper aims to analyze the literature on the cyber risk in the healthcare sector to understand the real knowledge on this topic. The findings highlight the poor attention of the scientific community on this topic, except in the United States. The literature lacks research contributions to support cyber risk management in subject areas such as Business, Management and Accounting; Social Science; and Mathematics. This research outlines the need to empirically investigate the cyber risk, giving a practical solution to health facilities.

Modeling and Forecasting of COVID-19 Spreading by Delayed Stochastic  Differential Equations	Marouane Mahrouf,Adnane Boukhouima,Houssine Zine,El Mehdi Lotfi,Delfim F. M. Torres,Noura Yousfi	2021/02/04			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04260v1	ArXiv	The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia has posed a great threat to the world recent months by causing many deaths and enormous economic damage worldwide. The first case of COVID-19 in Morocco was reported on 2 March 2020, and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. In this work, we extend the well-known SIR compartmental model to deterministic and stochastic time-delayed models in order to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco and to assess the potential role of multiple preventive measures and strategies imposed by Moroccan authorities. The main features of the work include the well-posedness of the models and conditions under which the COVID-19 may become extinct or persist in the population. Parameter values have been estimated from real data and numerical simulations are presented for forecasting the COVID-19 spreading as well as verification of theoretical results.	1679
FLOP: Federated Learning on Medical Datasets using Partial Networks	Qian Yang,Jianyi Zhang,Weituo Hao,Gregory Spell,Lawrence Carin	2021/02/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05218v2	ArXiv	The outbreak of COVID-19 Disease due to the novel coronavirus has caused a shortage of medical resources. To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process, automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data. However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a simple yet effective algorithm, named \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning \textbf{o}n Medical Datasets using \textbf{P}artial Networks (FLOP), that shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without sharing local patients' data.	1680
Protein corona critically affects the bio-behaviors of SARS-CoV-2	Yue-wen Yin,Yan-jing Sheng,Min Wang,Song-di Ni,Hong-ming Ding,Yu-qiang Ma	2021/02/10			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05440v1	ArXiv	The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide public health crisis. When the SARS-CoV-2 enters the biological fluids in the human body, different types of biomolecules (in particular proteins) may adsorb on its surface and alter its infection ability. Although great efforts have recently been devoted to the interaction of the specific antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2, it still remains largely unknown how the other serum proteins affect the infection of the SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we systematically investigate the interaction of serum proteins with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by the molecular docking and the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the non-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) indeed cannot effectively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD while the human serum albumin (HSA) may have some potential of blocking its infection (to ACE2). More importantly, we find that the RBD can cause the significant structural change of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), by which SARS-CoV-2 may hijack the metabolic pathway of the ApoE to facilitate its cell entry. The present study enhances the understanding of the role of protein corona in the bio-behaviors of SARS-CoV-2, which may aid the more precise and personalized treatment for COVID-19 infection in the clinic.	1681
Transfer Learning Approach for Arabic Offensive Language Detection  System -- BERT-Based Model	Fatemah Husain,Ozlem Uzuner	2021/02/09			http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05708v1	ArXiv	Developing a system to detect online offensive language is very important to the health and the security of online users. Studies have shown that cyberhate, online harassment and other misuses of technology are on the rise, particularly during the global Coronavirus pandemic in 2020. According to the latest report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 35% of online users reported online harassment related to their identity-based characteristics, which is a 3% increase over 2019. Applying advanced techniques from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field to support the development of an online hate-free community is a critical task for social justice. Transfer learning enhances the performance of the classifier by allowing the transfer of knowledge from one domain or one dataset to others that have not been seen before, thus, supporting the classifier to be more generalizable. In our study, we apply the principles of transfer learning cross multiple Arabic offensive language datasets to compare the effects on system performance. This study aims at investigating the effects of fine-tuning and training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model on multiple Arabic offensive language datasets individually and testing it using other datasets individually. Our experiment starts with a comparison among multiple BERT models to guide the selection of the main model that is used for our study. The study also investigates the effects of concatenating all datasets to be used for fine-tuning and training BERT model. Our results demonstrate the limited effects of transfer learning on the performance of the classifiers, particularly for highly dialectic comments.	1682
