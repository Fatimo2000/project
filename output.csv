What Risk Factors to Cause Long COVID and Its Impact on Patient Survival   Outcomes when Combined with the Effect from Organ Transplantation in the   Acute COVID. Coronavirus disease 2019 in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients is associated with more severe outcomes than non-immunosuppressed hosts. However, exactly which risk factors cause Long COVID in acute COVID cases remains unknown. More importantly, the impact of Long COVID on patient survival remains understudied, especially when examined alongside the effect of SOT. All patients have been identified with acute COVID in the National COVID Collaborative Cohort registry. We compared patient demographics in Long COVID vs. those without Long COVID based on descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistics regressions were used to determine the factors related to the likelihood of developing Long COVID from a case of acute COVID. Multi-variables Cox regression was used to determine the time-to-event outcome of patient survival with Long COVID. This study reviewed data from a cohort of 6,416,500 acute COVID patients. Of that group, 31,744 patients developed Long COVID from ICD diagnosis. The mean (q1, q3) age was 39 (22, 57) years old, and 55% of patients were female. From this cohort, a total of 31,744 (1%) developed Long COVID and 43,565 (1%) had SOT, with a total of 698 SOT patients identified with Long COVID. Mean age of those with Long COVID was 52 (39, 64) years old and 64% of patients were female. Most of the SOT patients were kidney transplant recipients. From the Cox regression analysis of patient survival, there were many significant factors related to patient survival, with elderly SOT patients having a much higher hazard ratio of 27.8 (26.3, 29.4). This study has identified the important risk factors that are more likely to cause Long COVID in an acute COVID cohort. We investigated hazard ratios of patient survival based on multivariable Cox models, which found that Long COVID had a more direct impact on survival in elderly patients and those with SOT.	arxiv	101
COVID-Net MLSys: Designing COVID-Net for the Clinical Workflow. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate globally, one promising field of research is machine learning-driven computer vision to streamline various parts of the COVID-19 clinical workflow. These machine learning methods are typically stand-alone models designed without consideration for the integration necessary for real-world application workflows. In this study, we take a machine learning and systems (MLSys) perspective to design a system for COVID-19 patient screening with the clinical workflow in mind. The COVID-Net system is comprised of the continuously evolving COVIDx dataset, COVID-Net deep neural network for COVID-19 patient detection, and COVID-Net S deep neural networks for disease severity scoring for COVID-19 positive patient cases. The deep neural networks within the COVID-Net system possess state-of-the-art performance, and are designed to be integrated within a user interface (UI) for clinical decision support with automatic report generation to assist clinicians in their treatment decisions.	arxiv	102
COVID-19-CT-CXR: a freely accessible and weakly labeled chest X-ray and   CT image collection on COVID-19 from biomedical literature. The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.	arxiv	103
COVID-Net UV: An End-to-End Spatio-Temporal Deep Neural Network   Architecture for Automated Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection from Ultrasound   Videos. Besides vaccination, as an effective way to mitigate the further spread of COVID-19, fast and accurate screening of individuals to test for the disease is yet necessary to ensure public health safety. We propose COVID-Net UV, an end-to-end hybrid spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture, to detect COVID-19 infection from lung point-of-care ultrasound videos captured by convex transducers. COVID-Net UV comprises a convolutional neural network that extracts spatial features and a recurrent neural network that learns temporal dependence. After careful hyperparameter tuning, the network achieves an average accuracy of 94.44% with no false-negative cases for COVID-19 cases. The goal with COVID-Net UV is to assist front-line clinicians in the fight against COVID-19 via accelerating the screening of lung point-of-care ultrasound videos and automatic detection of COVID-19 positive cases.	arxiv	104
Ensemble CNN models for Covid-19 Recognition and Severity Perdition From   3D CT-scan. Since the appearance of Covid-19 in late 2019, Covid-19 has become an active research topic for the artificial intelligence (AI) community. One of the most interesting AI topics is Covid-19 analysis of medical imaging. CT-scan imaging is the most informative tool about this disease. This work is part of the 2nd COV19D competition, where two challenges are set: Covid-19 Detection and Covid-19 Severity Detection from the CT-scans. For Covid-19 detection from CT-scans, we proposed an ensemble of 2D Convolution blocks with Densenet-161 models. Here, each 2D convolutional block with Densenet-161 architecture is trained separately and in testing phase, the ensemble model is based on the average of their probabilities. On the other hand, we proposed an ensemble of Convolutional Layers with Inception models for Covid-19 severity detection. In addition to the Convolutional Layers, three Inception variants were used, namely Inception-v3, Inception-v4 and Inception-Resnet. Our proposed approaches outperformed the baseline approach in the validation data of the 2nd COV19D competition by 11% and 16% for Covid-19 detection and Covid-19 severity detection, respectively.	arxiv	105
Comprehensively identifying Long Covid articles with human-in-the-loop   machine learning. A significant percentage of COVID-19 survivors experience ongoing multisystemic symptoms that often affect daily living, a condition known as Long Covid or post-acute-sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, identifying scientific articles relevant to Long Covid is challenging since there is no standardized or consensus terminology. We developed an iterative human-in-the-loop machine learning framework combining data programming with active learning into a robust ensemble model, demonstrating higher specificity and considerably higher sensitivity than other methods. Analysis of the Long Covid collection shows that (1) most Long Covid articles do not refer to Long Covid by any name (2) when the condition is named, the name used most frequently in the literature is Long Covid, and (3) Long Covid is associated with disorders in a wide variety of body systems. The Long Covid collection is updated weekly and is searchable online at the LitCovid portal: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/docsum?filters=e_condition.LongCovid	arxiv	106
